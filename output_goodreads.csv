If you like to read about spirituality and are tolerant of its many forms and traditions, then this book may be just the thing for you. It is a selection from the writings of an early Daoist philosopher, chosen and rendered into English by an American Catholic Trappist monk with a great sympathy for zen Buddhism. Oh, and it possesses a brief preface by his Holiness, the Dalai Lama.Confucian practice comes in for much criticism in this book, but I think this is because Daoism is concerned about the experience of being and enlightenment, whereas Confucianism is concerned with the proprieties of social behavior. If Chuang Tzu rails at the students of Confucianism, he does so in much the same spirit with which Jesus criticizes the scribes and the pharisees. He wishes to lead them past the practices to the heart within all of us.Thomas Merton is not fluent in Chinese, and does not claim to be, but as he is a real poet his Chang Tzu renditions travel to the heart within all of us too.Here are a few examples I have chosen, principally because I liked them and they were a little shorter than the rest:
THE NEED TO WINWhen an archer is shootingHe has all his skill.If he shoots for a brass buckleHe is already nervous.If he shoots for a prize of goldHe goes blindor sees two targets—he is out of his mind!His skill has not changed. But the prizeDivides him. He cares.He thinks more of winningThan of shooting—And the need to windDrains him of power. APOLOGIESIf a man steps on a stranger’s footIn the marketplace,He makes a polite apologyAnd offers an explanation(This place is so terriblyCrowded!”)If an elder brotherSteps on his younger brother’s foot,He says, “Sorry!”And that is that.If a parentTreads on his child’s foot,Nothing is said at all.The greatest politenessIs free of all formality.Perfect conduct is free of concern.Perfect wisdomIs unplanned.Perfect loveIs without demonstrations.Perfect sincerity offersNo guarantee.THE USELESSHui Tzu said to Chuang Tzu:“All your teaching is centered on what has no use.”Chuang replied:“If you have no appreciation for what has no useYou cannot begin to talk about what can be used.The earth, for example, is broad and vastBut of all that expanse a man uses only a few inchesUpon which he happens to be standing.Now suppose you suddenly take awayAll that he is not actually usingSo that, all around his fee a gulfYawns, and he stands in the Void,With nowhere solid except right under each foot:How long will he be able to use what he is using?”Hui Tzu: “It would cease to serve any purpose.”Chuang concluded”“This showsThe absolute necessityOf what has ‘no use’”

Even given that Merton did not read Chinese, I still think that his is a unique perspective, perhaps because he more than anyone else who has interpreted the Chuang Tzu has 'lived' the Chuang Tzu. What? Well think about it and read about how a Trappist monk lives. It is a life reduced to essentials and a life where the material life most of us cannot avoid living plays little part.“The man of TaoRemains unknownPerfect virtueProduces nothing‘No-Self’Is ‘True-Self’And the greatest man Is nobody.’ (p. 92)Perhaps more so these lines:“He goes his wayWithout relying on othersAnd does not pride himselfOn walking alone.” (p. 91)In my opinion a man who lived his life as humbly as Merton did is well qualified to interpret Chuang Tzu.I’m not suggesting that Thomas Merton is the only person who could have interpreted Chuang Tzu or Daoism. But, I am suggesting that he was uniquely qualified to do so and that his perspective is a very valuable one. That’s why I’ve kept this book on my shelf for 20 or so years and that’s why I go back to it.

It is a truly refreshing and delightful book of wise humour. Or, perhaps, humous wisdom.A couple of paragraphs from Merton's introduction stand out as worthy of citing:[My:] 'readings' [of Chuang Tzu:] are not attempts at faithful reproduction but ventures in personal and spiritual interpretation. Inevitably, any rendering of Chuang Tzu is bound to be very personal. Though, from the point of view of scholarship, I am not even a dwarf sitting on the shoulders of these giants, and though not all my renderings can even qualify as 'poetry,' I believe that a certain type of reader will enjoy my intuitive approach to a thinker who is subtle, funny, provocative, and not easy to get at (9).And:This book is not intended to prove anything or to convince anyone of anything that s/he does not want to hear about in the first place. In other words, it is not a new apologetic subtlety ... in which Christian rabbits will suddenly appear by magic out of a Taoist hat. I simply like Chuang Tzu because he is what he is and I feel no need to justify this liking to myself or to anyone else. He is far too great to need any apologies from me (10).

Among the classical Chinese philosophers (550-250 BCE), Chuang Tzu (d. 275) was the premier voice for Taoism. The Tao is regarded as mysterious, immune to description. Taoism's legendary founder, Lao Tzu (who may not have existed), states that ""The name that can be named is not the constant name.""

Among the classical Chinese philosophers (550-250 BCE), Chuang Tzu (d. 275) was the premier voice for Taoism. The Tao is regarded as mysterious, immune to description. Taoism's legendary founder, Lao Tzu (who may not have existed), states that ""The name that can be named is not the constant name."" In the same vein, Chuang Tzu writes that ""Tao is a name that indicates without defining."" Given this characterization or lack thereof, even a reference to ""the Tao"" is problematic as ""the"" qualifies Tao. Any attempt to define the Tao seems so fundamentally at odds with what Taoism is about. It is easy to get stuck and to resign oneself to a search for something vague but promising, something that unifies and quiets the soul. Yet, if Taoism is viewed as cosmic energy that operates dialectically (force, counter force, equilibrium), the Taoist epigrams of Chuang Tzu begin to make some sense. Ultimate reality is not a thing, but energy that pervades all (the cosmos, nature, human relationships). Energy, while formless, manifests itself in matter that moves in certain ways that reflect its inner makeup. Matter acts and matter reacts until equilibrium is achieved. That balance is then upset and this prompts new dialectic cycles. Absolute, Eternal stasis where time stops has no place in Taoism. The only permanent reality is change itself.The principle of change governs human affairs as well. Chuang Tzu's epigrams emphasize balance in the conduct of life. To stand out, by seeking fame and riches and power, is to upset that balance and, thereby, trigger adverse reaction (tension, conflict, violence) until order (balance) is restored. Non-striving and non-action are often interpreted as the need to retreat through self-denial. But these words can also mean that the self can attend to its basic needs without the excess that comes from striving too much and acting beyond proper bounds. While man may ""think he is surpassing others, others see him merely straining, stretching, to stand on tiptoe."" And, just who is the self? As in all life forms, each individual has his or her own nature: ""Water is for fish, and air for men. Natures differ, and needs with them."" Being true to one's nature brings peace and harmony to the soul as long as it is done with a sense of proportion and balance. This perspective stands in contrast with the Confucians who pushed individuals away from themselves and toward the needs of the social order. From the various commentaries on the subject, ""Tao"" generally means the ultimate pinciple that governs all, the path of the cosmos. ""Te"" is the Tao translated into the life principle. This is both the force or energy that pervades all of life and the principles of change and balance that govern all life forms and their interaction with each other and nature. Virtue is to follow these principles. ""Ching"" refers to one's essential nature. Virtue means to care and tend to our individual natures but to do so without asserting too much and without violating ""Te."" Arguably, this could be the story that Taoism tells. In the end, of course, the principle of change means that we, as all life forms do, must die and that our death, as death does throughout nature, begets new life. In our brief moment of life, though, it is in our interest to live within our bounds as individual and social harmony is the result. To assert oneself beyond those bounds brings only disharmony. As Chuang Tzu writes, ""There is no robber so dangerous as Nature (Yang and Yin). Yet it is not nature that does the damage: it is man's own will!""

a reference book on my shelf, which I return to again and again. Chuang Tzu illustrates the way with fables rather than epigrams. More approachable than Lao Tzu, thought some stories can be as enigmatic as truisms. Not a book to read through cover to cover in one sitting, but rather a book to leave around, and pick a page at random whenever guidance is needed.

The idea did not come from the Chinese text because Merton could not read Chinese. The idea must have come because Merton was able to push the English of translators into the interpretation that seemed to Merton, on the basis of his own experience as a meditator, to be correct. If you want to understand Merton then this translation may well help. If you want to understand Zhuang Zi then this translation can get you into trouble.

The Way of Chuang Tzu, by Thomas Merton, is the product of five years of immersion, study, prayer, and reflection on the work of Zhuangzi, one of the towering figures in Chinese Taoism (Daojia) who lived sometime between the Fourth and Third Century BC. According to Merton, the notes based on his meditative readings, ""have acquired a shape of their own and have become, as it were, 'imitations' of Chuang Tzu.""

The Way of Chuang Tzu, by Thomas Merton, is the product of five years of immersion, study, prayer, and reflection on the work of Zhuangzi, one of the towering figures in Chinese Taoism (Daojia) who lived sometime between the Fourth and Third Century BC. According to Merton, the notes based on his meditative readings, ""have acquired a shape of their own and have become, as it were, 'imitations' of Chuang Tzu."" Merton goes on to describe these imitations as personal spiritual interpretations and should not be mistaken for scholarship. What evolves then becomes a multi-layered tapestry of the poetic, intuitive, provocative, and complex. Merton has found a kindred spirit in Chuang Tzu, and there is little doubt that Merton and Master Chuang share a viewpoint of life that may be common to many monastics across a broad spectrum of religious and philosophical disciplines. This kinship needs no justification by Merton, a towering figure of Twentieth Century Catholicism in his own right; and Merton goes on to say that he ""may be pardoned for consorting with a Chinese recluse who shares the climate and peace of my own kind of solitude, and who is my own kind of person."" To attempt an understanding of Chuang Tzu, it is essential to understand the world in which he lived. Confucianism was the dominant Chinese philosophy of Chuang Tzu's time; and while Chuang Tzu often ridiculed Confucianism as too restrictive, it would be too simplistic to state that Taoism stood in direct contrast to Confucianism. According to Merton, ""if Chuang Tzu reacted against the Ju doctrine [of Confucianism], it was not in the name of something lower-the animal spontaneity of the individual who does not want to be bothered with a lot of tiresome duties-but in the name of something altogether higher. This is the most important fact to remember when we westerners confront the seeming antinomianism of Chuang Tzu or of the Zen masters."" While Confucius could advocate for Tao, Chuang Tzu believed that he was not referring to what he believed was the ""great Tao"" which is invisible and incomprehensible-the Eternal Tao. For Chuang Tzu, the Eternal Tao was the source of all things. Chuang Tzu critiqued Confucius because he refused to focus his teachings on the Eternal Tao simply because it was unknowable. According to Chuang Tzu, only when one was connected in some way to the Eternal Tao (a connection beyond both words and silence), could one truly begin to understand how to live. Merton interprets Confucian understanding of Tao to be an ""ethical Tao"" or a ""Tao of man,"" and he equates this understanding to be on par with the Christian interpretation of the Golden Rule. Merton concludes that this interpretation of Tao is not the Eternal Tao that Chuang Tzu espouses. Chuang Tzu eventually discarded this Confucian interpretation as illusory; where everything is distilled and categorized into a universal ethic of Tao (The Tao of Fatherhood is given as an example). Merton brilliantly synthesizes Chuang Tzu's critique of the Confucian ethic of the ""Superior Man"" with the example of the heroic and the virtuous public servant by explaining that even the good and the noble person:Engages in a self-conscious and deliberate campaign to 'do his duty' in the belief that this is right and therefore productive of happiness. He sees 'happiness' and 'the good' as 'something to be attained,' and thus he places them outside himself in the world of objects. In so doing, he becomes involved in a division from which there is no escape: between the present, in which he is not yet in possession of what he seeks, and the future in which he thinks he will have what he desires... Chuang Tzu believed that abstractions such as ""happiness,"" ""virtue,"" and ""justice"" were concepts placed into the world of objects to be attained, and should be considered ambiguous at best, dangerous at worst. Here he means that whatever one considers good (the good) to be attained (as outside of one's self), the more the good becomes abstracted and unattainable. Instead, Chuang Tzu advocated Wu Wei, or non-action. According to Chuang Tzu, Wu Wei is not concerned with conscious planning; in fact self-conscious action of any type is restrictive and stands opposed to the Eternal Tao. When you are in harmony with the Eternal Tao, right action, virtue, and good, which always manifest at the appropriate time without self-conscious deliberation, will intuitively become known to you, and you will act with Tao in full freedom. This concept of Wu Wei is reminiscent of the Gospel passage from Saint Matthew, ""Then Jesus said to his disciples, ""Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me (MT 16:24)."" Dying to one's self or dying to one's self-consciousness is essential. Similarly, Saint Paul echoes this theme in Galatians 2:20 when he says, ""I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me."" It is not difficult to imagine the phrase sounding like this: I no longer live, but Tao (the Eternal Tao) lives in me. Here is where I believe Merton finds a kindred spirit in Chuang Tzu. Merton recognizes that Chuang Tzu is actually moving into an area of mysticism which goes beyond mere object good, into metaphysical truth. He does not disdain virtue, good, happiness etc...He transcends them. I like that Merton recognizes in Chuang Tzu a man who challenges Merton's own vocation to solitude and contemplation, and I admire Merton all the more for confronting Chuang Tzu's critiques of contemplation and the interior life by deeply connecting his monasticism with Tao. ""The true tranquility sought by the 'man of tao' is Ying ning, tranquility in the action of non-action, in other words, a tranquility which transcends the division between activity and contemplation by entering into union with the nameless and invisible Tao."" I believe Merton equates this with divine union. Finally, it is critical to understand that for Chuang Tzu, Tao is found everywhere; in the same way that Christians believe that God is both omnipresent and omniscient (Proverbs 15:3 The eyes of the Lord are everywhere, keeping watch on the wicked and the good). Merton connected to this abstraction personally. In living out Wu Wei, Chuang Tzu advocated a non-action that was in complete harmony with Tao-in other words-perfect action. Merton described this as ""action not carried out independently of Heaven and earth...in perfect harmony with the whole. It is not mere passivity, but it is action that seems both effortless and spontaneous because performed ""rightly,"" in perfect accordance with our nature and with our place in the scheme of things. It is completely free because there is in it no force and no violence. It is not ""conditioned"" or ""limited"" by our own individual needs and desires, or even by our own theories and ideas."" Today, when I read John 17:21, ""that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me,"" it is not difficult to think that Thomas Merton, perhaps more than any Catholic during the last century, truly recognized the common spiritual unity (the oneness of each other's souls as grounded in the Triune-One) we all share as brothers and sisters in this world. Reading The Way of Chuang Tzu, truly contemplating Merton’s interpretive message which is rooted in his own Christology, and then living it out through Chuang Tzu's idea of non-action, becomes a great way to continue the wonderful ecumenical work Merton engaged in so selflessly when he recognized how interconnected he was with his brother Chuang Tzu, and how God (Eternal Tao) ultimately connects all of us together in the oneness of mystery and truth.

Did I seem as the type of person who needed guidance? Was this a way to maneuver me into religion? On the back-page I read: ""Fishes are born into water. Man is born into Tao..."" This looked way too simplistic for my taste. Would I have the patience for it?And so the book stayed on my shelf for almost two years before I decided to give it another shot. This time, I ended up reading it in one sitting. Then I read it again, underlined many parts of it, looked back at the parts I liked, read a little more, kept the book near my bed, took comfort in the wisdom I discovered, and soon heard my voice telling random friends about Chuang Tzu and Taoism!Among the things I found particularly interesting was the concept of TAO: Tao does not mean ""God"". Tao is not some outer being or some person up there looking down at the little creatures that we are. Rather, Tao is a ""way"" which signifies a certain taste for ""simplicity, for humility, self-effacement, silence, and in general a refusal to take seriously the aggressivity, the ambition, the push, and the self-importance which one must display in order to get along in society. The other is a 'way' that prefers not to get anywhere in the world, or even in the field of some supposedly spiritual attainment."" The idea seems to be that there is no need to hold on to one's own knowledge, for holding on to knowledge or wisdom might lead to ""losing"" the peace of mind. ""The right way is to go easy - Is to forget the right way - And forget that the going is easy."" Part of the wisdom shared here is not to ""grasp"" to things (including wisdom) but rather to ""thrust them away"". Learn to ignore them, Chuang Tzu advises, try to get untied! ""If they are within yourself, You cannot destroy them piecemeal, But you can refuse To let them take effect. If they are both inside and outside, Do not try To hold on to Tao - Just hope that Tao Will keep hold of you!""Thomas Merton writes a very enjoyable introduction to the readings and study of Chuang Tzu He seems to have really ""grasped"" the simplicity of the importance of getting lost to save oneself. ""The life of riches, ambition, pleasure, is in reality an intolerable servitude in which one 'lives for what is always out of reach,' thirsting 'for survival in the future' and 'incapable of living in the present."" The book also gives some understanding of certain concepts. I especially liked the idea of ""WU WEI"", which refers to ""non-action, non-volitional living, obeying the Tao""; ""Wu Wei is not intent upon results and is not concerned with consciously laid plans or deliberately organized endeavors"" and according to Chuang Tzu: ""My greatest happiness consists precisely in doing nothing whatever that is calculated to obtain happiness... Perfect joy is to be without joy... if you ask 'what ought to be done' and 'what ought not to be done' on earth to produce happiness, I answer that these questions do not have [a fixed and predetermined] answer"" to suit every case."" If one is in harmony with Tao, Merton clarifies, the answer will make itself clear when the time comes to act, for then one will act not according to the human and self-conscious mode of deliberation, but according to the divine and spontaneous mode of wu wei, which is the mode of action of Tao itself, and is therefore the source of all good.Basically, Chuang Tzu insists on abandoning the ""need to win"", and gives attention to the humility of fully realizing one's own nothingness. This humility is not only 'cosmic' but it is also full of life and awareness. Chuang Tzu, Merton succeeds in explaining, does not look at paradise as ""something that has been irrevocably lost by sin and cannot be regained except by redemption. It is still ours, but we do not know it, since the effect of life in society is to complicate and confuse our existence, making us forget who we really are by causing us to become obsessed with what we are not. It is this self-awareness, which we try to increase and perfect by all sorts of methods and practices, that is really a forgetfulness of our true roots in the 'unknown Tao' and our solidarity in the 'uncarved block' in which there are as yet no distinctions."" There is much wisdom in this book and, unlike religious texts I have previously read, this one actually managed to make me feel comfortable while reading it. Perhaps that is due to the fact that Chuang Tzu realized the dangers of claiming knowledge or trying to convert others into one's own beliefs. He makes sure one does not stick to their creeds and principles or distinguish oneself from others, for that is actually harmful, and it is more useful to be useless in that respect.Act without activity, the concept repeats itself. Empty your boat. The water of the ocean is never filled - it is also never emptied. Achievement is the beginning of failure, fame is the beginning of disgrace. Like an infant, be free from care and be unaware of self. Act without reflecting. Grow without having the need to watch yourself growing. Be like a fish that swims unconcerned. ""When the shoe fits, the foot is forgotten.""

Chuang Tzu is considered the greatest of the Taoist writers (at least among those whose historical existence can be verified) that lived during the classic period of Chinese philosophy from 550 to 250 BC. This roughly parallels the timeline in Bible history from the time of the exile of Judah to Babylon and extending well into the ""400 years of silence"" between the OT and NT scriptures.

Chuang Tzu is considered the greatest of the Taoist writers (at least among those whose historical existence can be verified) that lived during the classic period of Chinese philosophy from 550 to 250 BC. This roughly parallels the timeline in Bible history from the time of the exile of Judah to Babylon and extending well into the ""400 years of silence"" between the OT and NT scriptures. If one has an openness to accept the idea of religious pluralism, then the teachings of Chuang Tzu may be considered as one form used by God to penetrate this period of silence in Christian prophetic teaching. Thomas Merton emphasizes that ""it would be a great mistake to confuse the Taoism of Chuang Tzu with the popular, degenerate amalgam of superstition, alchemy, magic, and health-culture which Taoism later became"". Merton finds a certain analogy between Chuang Tzu and St. Paul, although warns against pushing the analogy too far as Chuang Tzu ""lacks the profoundly theological mysticism of St. Paul"".The focal point of Chuang Tzu's teaching is the criticism of any pursuit that sees the ultimate good outside of oneself - as something to be acquired or attained through purposeful effort. Chuang Tzu claims that such a pursuit is an ultimate loss of freedom - in reality an intolerable servitude in which one ""lives for what is always out of reach,"" thirsting ""for survival in the future"" and ""incapable of living in the present.""Chuang Tzu understands the extent to which our daily activities are a slave to such ulterior motives. Yet he not only challenges the ulterior motives of the hedonist and utilitarian but also of the hero of virtue and duty. How many of us as Christians today would fall into this latter category?! Merton recognizes that once ""the good"" is externalized as something outside of oneself, to be attained by special and virtuous techniques (we are reminded that the ultimate good of God's love has already been given and can never be attained), we find that the study and analysis of the ""means"" becomes so commanding and all-consuming that the end is completely forgotten. Merton sees that ""this is, in fact, nothing but organized despair: 'the good' that is preached and exacted by the moralist thus finally becomes an evil, and all the more so since the hopeless pursuit of it distracts one from the real good which one already possesses and which one now despises or ignores."" How often do we see this when the church becomes preoccupied with attaining holiness through an emphasis on perfecting the moralisms of external behavior while forgetting the real good - which is love freely given and received.Therefore, the essence of the way proposed by Chuang Tzu is not the accumulation of virtue and merit, common in the philosophy taught in his day (and perhaps in much of Christendom today despite a vocalized and often hollow allegiance to a ""faith and not works"" religion), but the non-doing or non-action which is indifferent to results and unhindered by consciously laid plans or deliberately organized endeavors. In capturing the essence of Chuang Tzu's teaching, Merton recognizes that ""the other way, the way of conscious striving, even though it may claim to be a way of virtue, is fundamentally a way of self-aggrandizement, and it is consequently bound to come into conflict with Tao.""I found it intriguing to consider that the form that Chuang Tzu used to convey his teaching, the allegory and the parable, anticipated the form that the greatest teacher of truth, Jesus Christ, would one day rely on so extensively to convey truth to those who had ""ears to hear"".After Merton's thoughtful introduction to the teaching of Chuang Tzu, the bulk of this book is composed of the often witty and humorous short stories and parables of Chuang Tzu. So much of the truth in these parables hit home for me! The way of non-doing and non-action is such an important consideration for me, given the analytical, obsessive, controlling, striving and clinging tendencies that so often trip me up in my contemplative journey. Oh to know fully that all that is needed has already been given! I would never have expected to receive such help from an ancient mystic Chinese sage!

Can we step out of this rat race, step away from the advances in science and medicine, embrace non-action, become impassive to friends, to family, to fate? Is it possible? Is it desirable?

The poem I often relay to my friends and co-workers is that of the archer entitled ""Need To Win"" as translated by Merton. Beautiful and clear example of how his poetry addresses the heart of the issue at hand.I've cracked open the Tao Te Ching a few times, and I believe a more careful study will show its beauty more than the cursory one I've had time to do (a lot of linguistic beauty and play is lost in translation). But, Chuang Tzu's poetry is very accessible and conveys important concepts very quickly.I also find it intriguing and telling that Merton would find ChuangTzu, both contemplatives, and see parallels between his contemplative life and Chuang Tzu's.Definitely a must read at least once.

This also applies, “When he tries to extend his power over objects, those objects gain control of him.” (p.136). See also the chapter Active Life which reads, “Those who are caught in the machinery of power take no joy except in activity and change- the whirring of the machine!” (p.142)

Monk Thomas Merton reflects on the works of Chung Tzu, who lived in Asia nearly 2500 years ago. We are invited to release ourselves from servitude to riches, ambition, duty, and even virtue. The way begins with the simple good of being, in and through each moment. Happiness lies in doing nothing whatsoever calculated to obtain happiness, rather in bringing full presence to each situation, this making clear the path.

In that respect, this reminded me of Robert Lowell's book, ""Imitations."" Merton also gives an interesting overview of Chinese philosophy and its parallels to his particular interests, namely his mystic Christian monasticism. I will definitely read this again.I highlighted quite a few passages. The first bunch are from Merton's introduction. (The highlights didn't capture line breaks in the poems. Each new line started with a capitalized first letter.)there is a monastic outlook which is common to all those who have elected to question the value of a life submitted entirely to arbitrary secular presuppositions, dictated by social convention, and dedicated to the pursuit of temporal satisfactions which are perhaps only a mirage.---This book is not intended to prove anything or to convince anyone of anything that he does not want to hear about in the first place.---I simply like Chuang Tzu because he is what he is and I feel no need to justify this liking to myself or to anyone else.---Chuang Tzu is not concerned with words and formulas about reality, but with the direct existential grasp of reality in itself. Such a grasp is necessarily obscure and does not lend itself to abstract analysis. It can be presented in a parable, a fable, or a funny story about a conversation between two philosophers.---The book of the Bible which most obviously resembles the Taoist classics is Ecclesiastes. But at the same time there is much in the teaching of the Gospels on simplicity, childlikeness, and humility, which responds to the deepest aspirations of the Chuang Tzu book and the Tao Teh Ching.---He might easily be read today as one preaching a gospel of license and uncontrol. Chuang Tzu himself would be the first to say that you cannot tell people to do whatever they want when they don’t even know what they want in the first place!---After all, the idea that one can seriously cultivate his own personal freedom merely by discarding inhibitions and obligations, to live in self-centered spontaneity, results in the complete decay of the true self and of its capacity for freedom.---Personalism gives priority to the person and not the individual self. To give priority to the person means respecting the unique and inalienable value of the other person, as well as one’s own, for a respect that is centered only on one’s individual self to the exclusion of others proves itself to be fraudulent.---Chuang Tzu held that only when one was in contact with the mysterious Tao which is beyond all existent things, which cannot be conveyed either by words or by silence, and which is apprehended only in a state which is neither speech nor silence (xxv. II.) could one really understand how to live.---To put it simply, the hero of virtue and duty ultimately lands himself in the same ambiguities as the hedonist and the utilitarian. Why? Because he aims at achieving “the good” as object. He engages in a self-conscious and deliberate campaign to “do his duty” in the belief that this is right and therefore productive of happiness. He sees “happiness” and “the good” as “something to be attained,” and thus he places them outside himself in the world of objects. In so doing, he becomes involved in a division from which there is no escape: between the present, in which he is not yet in possession of what he seeks, and the future in which he thinks he will have what he desires: between the wrong and the evil, the absence of what he seeks, and the good that he hopes to make present by his efforts to eliminate the evils; between his own idea of right and wrong, and the contrary idea of right and wrong held by some other philosophical school. And so on.---Chuang Tzu agrees with the paradox of Lao Tzu, “When all the world recognizes good as good, it becomes evil,” because it becomes something that one does not have and which one must constantly be pursuing until, in effect, it becomes unattainable.---The more “the good” is objectively analyzed, the more it is treated as something to be attained by special virtuous techniques, the less real it becomes. As it becomes less real, it recedes further into the distance of abstraction, futurity, unattainability. The more, therefore, one concentrates on the means to be used to attain it. And as the end becomes more remote and more difficult, the means become more elaborate and complex, until finally the mere study of the means becomes so demanding that all one’s effort must be concentrated on this, and the end is forgotten.---The way of Tao is to begin with the simple good with which one is endowed by the very fact of existence.---If one is in harmony with Tao—the cosmic Tao, “Great Tao”—the answer will make itself clear when the time comes to act, for then one will act not according to the human and self-conscious mode of deliberation, but according to the divine and spontaneous mode of wu wei, which is the mode of action of Tao itself, and is therefore the source of all good.---The other way, the way of conscious striving, even though it may claim to be a way of virtue, is fundamentally a way of self-aggrandizement, and it is consequently bound to come into conflict with Tao.---Chuang Tzu is not against virtue (why should he be?), but he sees that mere virtuousness is without meaning and without deep effect either in the life of the individual or in society.---All deliberate, systematic, and reflexive “self-cultivation,” whether active or contemplative, personalistic or politically committed, cuts one off from the mysterious but indispensible contact with Tao, the hidden “Mother” of all life and truth.---No one is so wrong as the man who knows all the answers.---A program or a system has this disadvantage: it tends to situate happiness in one kind of action only and to seek it only there. But the happiness and freedom which Chuang Tzu saw in Tao is to be found everywhere (since Tao is everywhere), and until one can learn to act with such freedom from care that all action is “perfect joy because without joy,” one cannot really be happy in anything.---The true character of wu wei is not mere inactivity but perfect action— because it is act without activity. In other words, it is action not carried out independently of Heaven and earth and in conflict with the dynamism of the whole, but in perfect harmony with the whole. It is not mere passivity, but it is action that seems both effortless and spontaneous because performed “rightly,” in perfect accordance with our nature and with our place in the scheme of things. It is completely free because there is in it no force and no violence. It is not “conditioned” or “limited” by our own individual needs and desires, or even by our own theories and ideas.---What is impossible today may suddenly become possible tomorrow. What is good and pleasant today may, tomorrow, become evil and odious. What seems right from one point of view may, when seen from a different aspect, manifest itself as completely wrong.---When a limited and conditioned view of “good” is erected to the level of an absolute, it immediately becomes an evil, because it excludes certain complementary elements which are required if it is to be fully good.---He retains his perspective and clarity of judgment, so that he knows that “Yes” is “Yes” in the light of the “No” which stands over against it. He understands that happiness, when pushed to an extreme, becomes calamity. That beauty, when overdone, becomes ugliness. Clouds become rain and vapor ascends again to become clouds. To insist that the cloud should never turn to rain is to resist the dynamism of Tao.---The pivot of Tao passes through the center where all affirmations and denials converge. He who grasps the pivot is at the still-point from which all movements and oppositions can be seen in their right relationship. Hence he sees the limitless possibilities of both “Yes” and “No.”---No one seems to know How useful it is to be useless.---“All the fish needs Is to get lost in water. All man needs is to get lost In Tao.”---By ethical argument And moral principle The greatest crimes are eventually shown To have been necessary, and, in fact, A signal benefit To mankind.---This one sees in the dark, hears where there is no sound. In the deep dark he alone sees light. In soundlessness he alone perceives music. He can go down into the lowest of low places and find people. He can stand in the highest of high places and see meaning. He is in contact with all beings. That which is not, goes his way. That which moves is what he stands on. Great is small for him, long is short for him, and all his distances are near.---The bird opens its beak and sings its note And then the beak comes together again in Silence.---The sage is quiet because he is not moved, Not because he wills to be quiet. Still water is like glass. You can look in it and see the bristles on your chin. It is a perfect level; A carpenter could use it.---From emptiness comes the unconditioned. From this, the conditioned, the individual things. So from the sage’s emptiness, stillness arises: From stillness, action. From action, attainment.---There are no fixed limits Time does not stand still. Nothing endures, Nothing is final.---Nothing endures, Nothing is final.---The game is never over Birth and death are even The terms are not final.---Can a man cling only to heaven And know nothing of earth? They are correlative: to know one Is to know the other. To refuse one Is to refuse both.---Kui, the one-legged dragon, Is jealous of the centipede. The centipede is jealous of the snake. The snake is jealous of the wind. The wind is jealous of the eye. The eye is jealous of the mind.---The man in whom Tao Acts without impediment Harms no other being By his actions Yet he does not know himself To be “kind,” to be “gentle.” The man in whom Tao Acts without impediment Does not bother with his own interests And does not despise Others who do.---“Go home!” said Chuang Tzu. “Leave me here To drag my tail in the mud!”---I ask myself if after all their concept of happiness has any meaning whatever. My opinion is that you never find happiness until you stop looking for it. My greatest happiness consists precisely in doing nothing whatever that is calculated to obtain happiness: and this, in the minds of most people, is the worst possible course.---My opinion is that you never find happiness until you stop looking for it.---Contentment and well-being at once become possible the moment you cease to act with them in view, and if you practice non-doing (wu wei), you will have both happiness and well-being.---“Heaven and earth do nothing Yet there is nothing they do not do.""---So a drunken man, falling Out of a wagon, Is bruised but not destroyed.---If there is such security in wine, How much more in Tao.---So, when the shoe fits The foot is forgotten, When the belt fits The belly is forgotten, When the heart is right “For” and “against” are forgotten.---The right way to go easy Is to forget the right way And forget that the going is easy.---The straight tree is the first to be cut down, The spring of clear water is the first to be drained dry.---Such is the perfect man: His boat is empty.---Those who are caught in the machinery of power take no joy except in activity and change—the whirring of the machine! Whenever an occasion for action presents itself, they are compelled to act; they cannot help themselves.---Where there is no longer word or silence Tao is apprehended.---“If you have no appreciation for what has no use You cannot begin to talk about what can be used.""

I am finally reading it after conversations about Chinese philosophy and religion with several Chinese undergraduates on a field trip to Chicago. I purchased it at the Richland Community College bookstore, sometime during the summer of 1992, before I had heard of either Thomas Merton or Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu).As I later learned, Zhuangzi was the second great expositor of Daojiao or Daoist (Taoist) philosophy, following a few centuries after the legendary Laozi (Lao Tzu). Instead of propounding his ideas in condensed, poetic form, as per Laozi, Zhuangzi conveyed his understanding of the Dao in oftentimes funny narratives, many of which Merton here renders into long-form poetry. His conception of the inconceivable Dao differs significantly from Laozi's in many ways, most obvious of which is the earthy humor which infuses his parables. This is not a new translation, unlike several other editions on my shelf (many of which have been sitting unread for nearly as long as this one). Rather it is a selection and re-rendering of existing English translations on the part of Catholic priest and monk, poet and painter, writer and intellectual Thomas Merton, who also provided a most insightful short study of Zhuangzhi as a preface. On the Confucian virtue of ""propriety"" or Li:Li  is something more than exterior and ritual correctness: it is the ability to make use of ritual forms to give full outward expression to the love and obligation by which one is bound to others. Li is the acting out of veneration and love, not only for parents, for one's sovereign, for one's people, but also for ""Heaven-and-earth."" It is a liturgical contemplation of the religious and metaphysical structure of the person, the family, society, and the cosmos itself....One learns by Li to take one's place gratefully in the cosmos and in history. (pp.18-9)A contemplative and interior life which would simply make the subject more aware of himself and permit him to become obsessed with his own interior progress would, for Chuang Tzu, be no less an illusion than the active life of the ""benevolent"" man who would try to hide his own efforts to impose his idea of the good on those who might oppose this ideaand thus in his eyes, become ""enemies of the good."" The true tranquility sought by the ""man of Tao"" is Ying ning, tranquility in the action of non-action, in other words, a tranquility which transcends the division between activity and contemplation by entering into union with the nameless and invisible Tao. (p. 26)The abstract theory of ""universal love"" preached by Mo Ti was shrewdly seen by Chuang Tzu to be false precisely because of the inhumanity of its consequences. In theory, Mo ti held that all men should be loved with an equal love, that the individual should find his own greatest good in loving the common good of all, that universal love was rewarded by the tranquility, peace, and good order of all, and the happiness of the individual. But this ""universal love"" will be found upon examination (like most other utopian projects) to make such severe demands upon human nature that it cannot be realized, and indeed, even if it could be realized it would in fact cramp and distort man, eventually ruining both him and his society. Not because love is not good and natural to man, but because a system constructed on a theoretical and abstract principles of love ignores certain fundamental and mysterious realities, of which we cannot be fully conscious, and the price we pay for this inattention is that our ""love"" in fact becomes hate. (pp. 28-9)That Chuang Tzu should be able to take one side of a question in one place, and the other side in another context, warns us that in reality he is beyond mere partisan dispute. Though he is a social critic, his criticism is never bitter or harsh. Irony and parable are his chief instruments, and the whole climate of his work is one of the tolerant impartiality which avoids preaching and recognizes the uselessness of dogmatizing about obscure ideas that even the philosophers were not prepared to understand. Thought he did not follow other men in their follies, he did not judge them severelyhe knew that he had follies of his own, and had the good sense to accept the fact and enjoy it. (pp. 29-30)For security against robbers who snatch purses, rifle luggage, and crack safes,One must fasten all property with ropes, lock it up with locks, bolt it with bolts.This (for property owners) is elementary good sense.But when a strong thief comes along he picks up the whole lot,Puts it on his back, and goes on his way with only one fear:That ropes, locks, and bolts may give way.Thus what the world calls good business is only a wayTo gather up the loot, pack it, make it secureIn one convenient load for the more enterprising thieves.Who is there, among those called smart,Who does not spend his time amassing lootFor a bigger robber than himself? (p. 67)In the age when life on earth was full, no one paid any special attention to worthy men, not did they single out the man of ability. Rulers were simply the highest branches on the tree, and the people were like deer in the woods. They were honest and righteous without realizing that they were ""doing their duty."" They loved each other and did not know that this was ""love of neighbor."" they deceived no one yet they did not know that they were ""men to be trusted."" They were reliable and did not know that this was ""good faith."" They lived freely together giving and taking, and did not know that they were generous. For this reason their deeds have not been narrated. They made no history. (p. 76)When an archer is shooting for nothingHe has all his skill.If he shoots for a brass buckleHe is already nervous.If he shoots for a prize of goldHe goes blindOr he sees two targets‒He is out of his mind!His skill has not changed. But the prizeDivides him. He cares.He thinks more of winningThan of shooting‒And the need to winDrains him of power. (p.107)If you can empty your own boatCrossing the river of the world,No one will oppose you,No one will seek to harm you. (p. 114)""Where self-interest is the bond,The friendship is dissolvedWhen calamity comes.Where Tao is the bond,Friendship is made perfectBy calamity."" (p. 116)The purpose of words is to convey ideas. When the ideasare grasped, the words are forgotten.Where can I find a man who has forgotten words? He is the one I would like to talk to. (p. 154)

18873852,      The Way of Chuang Tzu,Bernie Gourley,41617,it was amazing,"

The Way of Chuang Tzu is Thomas Merton’s take on Chuang Tzu’s lessons of Taoism. One might ask why a person should learn about Taoism from a Trappist monk any more than one would learn the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi from a Zen monk. Maybe you should and maybe you shouldn’t, but I think Merton did a remarkable job in putting this book together and that there’s a lot to be learned from it.

The Way of Chuang Tzu is Thomas Merton’s take on Chuang Tzu’s lessons of Taoism. One might ask why a person should learn about Taoism from a Trappist monk any more than one would learn the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi from a Zen monk. Maybe you should and maybe you shouldn’t, but I think Merton did a remarkable job in putting this book together and that there’s a lot to be learned from it. Some may find a fresh fusion in Merton’s approach to Chuang Tzu.What I like most about this version of Chuang Tzu’s teachings is that Merton doesn’t foul it up with a bunch of analysis. Because the lessons are short and—admittedly, in some cases—arcane, there’s a temptation to write in a bunch of explanation and analysis—both to hit a page quota and to prove how smart the translator is. Ironically, some don’t seem to see the irony of rambling on in explication of Taoism—a philosophy that advocates simplicity and rebukes the wordy for their arrogance. Merton doesn’t fall into this trap. He offers a few pages of introduction as context for the reader, and then moves straight into 62 lessons of Chuang Tzu.I’d say the introduction is useful, particularly for individuals without a great deal of background in Taoism. In it, Merton gives insight into potentially confusing topics like wu-wei (actionlessness), the yin/yang dichotomy, and the divergence of Taoists from Confucian scholars on the four-fold Ju philosophy of virtue. However, the intro can also be skipped if you do know a about Chinese philosophy, and don’t care to read a commentary on Taoism inflected with Trappist worldview. (Taoists may want to skip the intro if they’re prone to becoming infuriated by an outsider proposing that their life philosophy took a wrong turn along the way. Merton suggests that one shouldn’t confuse Chuang Tzu’s Taoism with what the system has become, the implication being that it was a sound philosophy and became voodoo hokum in modern times.) Merton does inevitably project some of his own worldview as a Christian monk into Chuang Tzu’s teachings. Some might find this to make for a refreshing commentary on it, and others may find it a bit off the mark on occasion.Merton’s poetic background serves him well here as many of the lessons are in poetic form—partially or totally. Translating poetry is one of the most difficult linguistic tasks imaginable. Merton has the added challenge of never having read the original. He doesn’t read any Chinese languages. He did, however, consult four different translations in three different languages (English, French, and German.) This, of course, means that besides Merton being in the text, there’s a further seepage of Western framing into these Eastern teachings. I’ll leave it to the reader to decide whether this is a good or bad thing, and arguments could be made either way. One of the strengths of Chuang Tzu’s lessons is his use of the narrative form. That is, the Taoist sage liked to use stories to impart his wisdom, like the wheelwright who insults the Emperor but then ends up teaching him a valued lesson. One of my favorites is the story about the Prince of Chu sending out high ranking emissaries to appoint Chuang Tzu to a ministerial post. Chuang Tzu explains why he is turning down the offer by way of an allegory about a turtle. Chuang Tzu also uses dialogue to get his point across in a way that is easy to follow and clear. A prime example of this is the discussion between Chuang Tzu and Hui Tzu about the happiness of fishes, which has an almost Socratic ring to it. The combination of story and dialogue makes Chuang Tzu’s lessons sometimes easier to follow than the Tao Te Ching of Lao Tzu. Lao Tzu tends to be more arcane by way of his use of short, declarative statements that are more vague and abstract (that could be a good thing, but given vast loss of cultural context it might be confusing as well.) I’d recommend this book for anyone interested in Taoism. I enjoyed the Merton’s sparse approach, and think that he does a good job conveying Chuang Tzu’s lessons.

What Hemingway is with efficiency for sorrow, Chuang Tzu - as interpreted by Thomas Merton - is the master of efficiency for spiritual awe. This fascinating book says so much, so powerfully, using very little in terms of pomp and circumstance of text.If you want to pick this apart intellectually you are missing the point.I suppose you can put it this way. If you are asked to explain music, you could discuss the science of music or put on a song and just sit back and put on a song. The Way of Chuang Tzu is more like putting on a song. The message is simple, clear, and powerful – abandon earthly aims. Serve not just humanity, but the greater spirit of the cosmos. Follow the Tao of custom and culture, but remember that’s just the start. Recognize there is a higher divinity that cannot be named.One of my favorite Rumi lines is, “there is another within, by whom these eyes sparkle.” To which I think Chuang Tzu would add, “the other within cannot be named and can only be found through non-action.” Do less, surrender to the unity and take your ego aims out of the equation. You will find bliss only when you stop trying to find it and stop trying to judge experiences as joyful or not. David Brooks makes a similar point in The Road to Character. The way to gain riches and worldly success is to try, do, improve, better, smarter, faster, etc. Modern society is all about that. The way to spiritual richness is different. It is about surrender, non-action, and faith in the Tao that cannot be named as opposed to the one we honor through tradition. Modern society has forgotten the spirit. We take anti-depressants instead of listening to the masters at the art of living. This is a powerful book.QuotesThe Breath of NatureWhen great Nature sighs, we hear the winds…have you not heard / this rush of tones?Something is blowing on a thousand different holes.Some power stands behind all this and makes the sounds die down.What is this power?39Great Knowledge Great knowledge sees all in one.Small knowledge breaks down into the many…Enough! Enough!Early and late we meet the “that” From which all “these” grow!41The PivotWhen the wise man grasps this pivot, he is in the center of the circle, and there he stands while “yes” and “no” pursue each other around the circumference. 43Man is Born in TaoFishes are born in waterMan is born in Tao…If man, born in Tao, Sinks into the deep shadowOf non-actionTo forget aggression and concern,He lacks nothingHis life is secure. 65The Lost PearlHe lost his night-colored pearlHe sent out Science to seek his pearl, and got nothing.He sent out Analysis to look for his pearl, and got nothing.He sent out Logic to seek his pearl, and got nothing.Then he asked Nothingness, and Nothingness had it!74The Five EnemiesHow did they lose [the original simplicity of man]? Here are the five ways:Love of colors bewitches the earAnd it loses its true hearing.Love of perfumesFills the head with dizziness.Love of flavorsRuins the taste.Desires unsettle the heartUntil the original nature runs amok.These are the five enemies of true life. Yet these are what “men of discernment” claim to live for.They are not what I love for:If this if life, then pigeons in a cageHave found happiness!79My opinion is that you never find happiness until you stop looking for it…perfect joy is to be without joy. Perfect praise is to be without praise.When the Shoe FitsThe foot is forgotten,When the belt fitsThe belt is forgotten,When the heart is right“For” and “against” are forgotten. 112

Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk who lived at the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky (of all places), was buddies with the Dalai Lama. Yep, picture Christianity and Tibetan Buddhism hanging out side by side and learning from each other – acknowledging and sharing the wisdom that exists in each spiritual discipline. It's a beautiful thing, and not as rare as people think. As often as the world is torn apart by religious dissent, I think it's more important than ever to hold up these examples of harmony and respect between different schools of thought. But inevitably, the peaceful voices get drowned out by the hateful ones. Chuang Tzu was called the most spiritual of Chinese philosophers; he was the main historical spokesperson for Taoism (whose founder, Lao Tzu, is a legendary character mostly known through Chuang Tzu's own writings). This book collects many of Chuang Tzu's parables and sayings, adapted by Merton from multiple translations. Reading this, I can see exactly why Merton felt so at home with Taoism and Zen. It's reflected everywhere in his writings: his attempts to capture in words things that transcend words (while admitting his failure), to express the undefinable without defining it, to contemplate without self-awareness, etc. But the fascinating thing about Chuang Tzu is that, despite all his abstractions, he's quite practical at heart. He had plenty to say about social unbalance, the futility of political power, and the inadequacies of government (even when it's benevolent). Much of what he says reveals how little human society has changed in 2500+ years.For example: A poor man must swingFor stealing a belt buckleBut if a rich man steals a whole stateHe is acclaimedAs statesman of the year. He also points out the hypocrisy of philosophers and religious people who try so hard to be ""virtuous"" that they go trampling over others, failing to exist in the present moment, and so failing to connect with Tao (the source of all things) – the very end they were seeking. But Tao can't be an end! It's that age-old divine paradox:Tao is a name That indicatesWithout defining.Tao is beyond wordsAnd beyond things.It is not expressed Either in word or silence.Where there is no longer word or silenceTao is apprehended.In essence, Taoism is about letting go of the human need to control and define everything. We do this because we want to understand everything, but in trying to define the undefinable, we reduce it to a shell of itself, a thing that can be grasped by the human intellect. In which case we only end up ""understanding"" in part, never in whole. But we arrogantly claim to understand the whole. This rejection of pure rationality-as-god makes the ""Way"" just as countercultural today as I'm sure it was back in Chuang Tzu's time. This is both brain and soul food; I'm so glad I picked it up.

I picked this slim volume because it was written by Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk. His ""Seven Story Mountain"" has been recommended to me a bunch of times, but so far I've been intimidated by its length. Here I was impressed by the introductory essay- Merton has a clear, poetic style, and he presents an interesting analysis of the similarities and differences between the various monastic traditions- it struck me as rare and beautiful reading a Catholic monk writing about Buddhism. His readings from Chuang Tzu aren't really translations- Merton didn't read Chinese. Instead, he freely translated and transliterated from various books in English, German, and French. That might sound less authentic, but I think it allowed him to draw out more of the poetry in each selection. That's not to say he's fancy- quite the opposite. The simplicity and straightforwardness of each piece reminded me a lot of the readings in the Mumonkan and other Zen source books. The main difference seems to be that Taoism emphasizes going with the flow- embracing all of reality in an unmediated way- but places less emphasis on the sudden satori that characterizes most Zen koans. But both traditions emphasize being in tune with nature, and tell a lot of stories about talking animals. So if you enjoy that stuff in Zen, you'll find a lot to like here.

Although I feel that much of the gap was that these were written for a different time and a different culture. It makes some strong assumptions which are outright wrong. These fallacies might have worked several hundred years ago, but not anymore. The overall points still seem valid but the rational/logic the book uses to get to their conclusions are not.As they say, the tao that can be spoken is not the true tao. But the tao that is spoken of in this book was not very tao-ish at times. Oddly, many of the stories, which have a main character that is supposed to represent a person of tao, do not necessarily follow tao principles. They are often very judgy.One example would be the story of ""Good Fortune."" Where a parent gets upset when a son of theirs is prophecied to have good fortune. They get riled up because it would be un-tao-like to have the desires that good fortune often bring. Yet the follower of tao is experiencing obvious distress due to the attachment to their concept of how their child should end up. Tao and attachments like this don't go together.Best stories would be the Great and Small, which points out that everything is relative; and Means and Ends which talks about the purpose of a tool and the importance of not making the tool itself the object of admiration.

I spent a couple of years reading and re-reading this book. I found some real truth in the deliberateness of Chuang Tzu - more so than with Lao Tzu. His writing (hopefully his articulateness is not too deeply a reflection of Merton's) contains elements of the ubiquitous human stench that is too often left out of prettier works. He didn't turn away from the human condition and smooth over the roughness of the journey. He sat squarely, naked, in wet mud and banged his drum with glee. I felt so str

I really liked Merton's intro. Especially his explanation of wu wei, which I though he did a good job on. Although I've never actually read anything by him before I've read about him and he sounds like he was a pretty cool guy. I've not read much of Chuang Tzu's writing before, so I can't really say much about this translation in comparison to others. Don't know how I feel about the fact that it's an interpretation of translations. It's definitely easy to see Zen in much of the readings though.

Merton’s introduction, I think, is the best part. Much as I like his prose I’m not crazy about Merton’s poetry, and that’s largely what this is: Merton’s poetry rather than Chuang Tzu’s. Merton isn’t really translating from the Chinese (he couldn’t read it) but creating his own rendering of Chuang Tzu based on the translations of others. Taoist philosophy is fascinating and admirable, but I wonder if this is the best way to approach it.

I use the parables frequently to help my friends and family reflect on their life situations from a different perspective. It is an excellent introduction to Taoist thought, and a great companion for those already walking along the path.

There are many translations of Chuang Tzu, and all of them are quite different. My professor in college preferred this one and so this is the one I went with.

Well worth it.Carl Kruse

Thomas Merton: monk, icon of the Catholic left, Asia enthusiast. Here Merton gives us a beautiful idiomatic rendering of the Zhuangzi, some of the key texts of Taoism. I doubt that it's the *best* translation in the world, since Merton admits that he's not really an expert on classical Chinese...but what it probably lacks in accuracy it makes up for in lyricism. Being Catholic and of a mystical bent, Merton loves a paradox; it's this enthusiasm that makes the book great.

After the Han Dynasty, Zhuangzi was regarded as a real person in Nanhua, so ""Zhuangzi"" was also called ""Nanhua Jing"". It is collectively called ""San Xuan"" with ""Lao Zi"" and ""Zhou Yi"".

Foreign objects ""Tao De Jing"" and ""Zhuang Zi"" are two books that embody the core ideas of Taoism. The Tao Te Ching has only more than 5,000 words, but since the pre-Qin period, scholars of the past dynasties have made a lot of explanations, which is really amazing. If Laozi didn’t respond to Yin Xi’s request to write the Tao Te Ching when he rode a green cow west to Hangu Pass, I am afraid that Chinese history would be rewritten. After all, Taoist thought, like Confucian thought, had a profound influence on Chinese culture. . Just as ""Benevolence"" is the core idea of ""The Analects"", ""Tao"" is the core idea of ""Tao De Jing"". The Tao here has multiple meanings, sometimes referring to the way of the universe, the way of nature, and sometimes the way of personal practice. But Tao cannot be expressed in words, and words that can be expressed are not the real Tao. Virtue is the worldview and methodology of the seeker. Lao Tzu often uses water as an analogy. Water is soft but also powerful. The characteristic of ""the softest of the world and the strongest of the world"" represented by water is consistent with Lao Tzu's philosophy and political thought. Emphasis on letting the flow go and governing by doing nothing. I don't quite understand this point. If the world can be cured by doing nothing, if there is no pursuit in my heart, wouldn't it be muddled? The writing of ""Lao Tzu"" is fluent and in line with rhythm. After reading it a few times, it will be catchy. The beauty of writing is a major feature of pre-Qin prose. Just as Mencius expanded and promoted the Confucianism created by Confucius, Zhuangzi also inherited and developed Taoism created by Laozi. Zhuangzi's articles are magnificent and arrogant, and they are hearty to read. Zhuangzi is good at telling stories, he is unconstrained, he combines rich imagination with historical legends and makes sense through fables. Mencius's reasoning is more careful and rigorous, which is in line with the characteristics of Confucianism; while Zhuangzi blends the truths he wants to express into fables, which has a certain ""Tao is Tao, very Tao"". From a modern point of view, Confucianism tends to be strong and big government, while Taoism tends to be small or even anarchic. Confucianism entered the world actively, paying attention to magnanimity and benefiting the world; Taoism was a little passive, but it was more free and easy, regardless of fame and wealth. Since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty deposed a hundred schools of dominating Confucianism, Confucianism has mainly become the dominant culture of Chinese society for more than two thousand years. Taoism has become popular among the people and has become a complementary hidden culture. Both Confucianism and Taoism believe that there is power in the dark, but this power is not a creator such as God or Allah, but more like a rule or principle. ""The Analects of Confucius"" focuses on the present and the world, and is often reluctant to mention the subtle and unspeakable things like ""fate"". Confucius also ""does not talk about strange things,"" and once said that ""the unknown life can be known to die, but nothing can be done. ""How can people do ghosts"". Taoism pays more attention to this kind of ultimate question. The ""Tao"" given in the Tao Te Ching is related to the origin of the universe, but it is not a humanized role of the creator. The so-called ""Tao produces one, one life two, two produces three, three From a certain perspective, it is closer to the current human cosmology than the world created by gods. ""Also , if the water accumulation of the husband is not thick, the negative boat will be weak. If you put a cup of water on the col hall, you will be a boat, and if you put a cup on it, you will glue. If the water is shallow, the boat will be big. If it’s not thick, the wings will be weak. Therefore, the wind is going down for ninety thousand miles, and then the wind is peifeng ; those who carry the blue sky but don’t have the sorrow will be the south of the present. "" ""The wren nests in the deep forest, but only one branch; the rat drinks the river, but the stomach is full. Returning to the king! There is no use for the world. Although the people will not cure the people, the corpses will not go beyond the bottle and replace them.

The gathering of the family and the plan said: ""My life is 洴澼, but only a few gold. In one day, if you have a lot of skills, please go with it."" The guest got it, so as to talk about the king of Wu. The more difficult it is, the King Wu makes him general. In winter, fight with the Yueren in water, defeat the Yueren, and seal the ground.

The same talent , displayed at different times and occasions , has different results. "" Zi Qi said: ""The husband is very angry, and his name is wind. It is nothing to do, and to do it is to be angry. And the unheard? The fear of the mountain, the hole of the big wood, It resembles a nose, mouth, ears, a spine, a circle, a mortar, a depression, and a dirty one.

Therefore, there are Confucianism and Mohism, so that it is what it is and not what it is. If you want to be what it is and not what it is, there is no way to make it clear. "" "" He is not a mate, which is called a Taoist pivot. The pivot first gains its ring, to respond to infinity. Yes is also infinite, and neither is infinite. Therefore, it is said: No way to understand. "" ""The only one who knows and communicates is one, and because it is not used, it is used for the others. The mediocre person uses it; the person who uses it, the master; the person who knows it, gets it. It is enough. Because it is just enough. I don’t know how it is, it’s the way. I don’t know what it is like, and it’s the same as the one. What is the ""Chaosan""? What is the ""Chaosan""? Anger. Said: ""However, it is four days and three nights."" All the snipers are happy.

One and words are two, two and one are three From then on, there is no chance to get a calendar, but it is mundane! So there is nothing for it, so three, and there is nothing for it! There is nothing for it, because there is nothing! "" ""The husband’s way is not called, the big debates are not spoken, the benevolent is not benevolent, the incorruptible is not conceited, the courage is not stubborn . No abandon but a few to the side! So know what you don’t know, to know. Who knows without words, is not the way? If you can know, this is called Tianfu. Note that you are dissatisfied, and you are inexhaustible. Without knowing its origin, this is called Baoguang. "" ""Is it true that the deceased who knows the husband will not regret the birth of the beginning? Those who drink in dreams will cry once; those who cry in dreams will hunt in the fields. Fang has its dreams, but does not know its dreams. Dreams occupy their dreams, Feeling and then knowing their dreams. And having great enlightenment and then knowing the big dream. But the fool thinks he knows it, stealthily knowing it. Jun! Shepherd! Solid Qiu is also! Dreams with women! I call it a female dream , Yimeng also. It is its words, and its name is Paradox. After all ages, once encountering the Great Sage, who knows the solution is the one who meets in the evening. "" "" Even if I and Ruo argue, if I win, I won't win, and if I win, I won’t be wicked?

Divide. This is called materialization. "" "" My life has bounds, and knowing has no bounds. If there is bounds to follow without bounds, it is almost done! The one who knows already is almost done!

Wen Huijun said: ""Hey, good! Is the skill covered?"" Pao Ding explained the knife and said: ""Whoever is good at the minister is also more skilled. When the first official explained the cow, he saw nothing more than the whole cow; after three years, he had never seen the whole cow. At this time, the official met with the gods instead of looking at them, and the officials knew to stop and the gods wanted to do. According to the laws of nature, criticize the big but lead the big qi, because it is. It's not a taste of the branch, but the situation is dwarfed! Liang Pao changed his knife and cut it at the old age; the clan Pao Yue changed his knife and cut it. The sword of Jinchen has been around for nineteen years, and it has solved thousands of cattle, and the blade is like a new one. There is a gap between those who have the same festival and the blade is not thick. If there is no thickness, there must be room for recovery. Therefore, in 19 years, the blade is renewed in 硎. Although, as far as the family is concerned, I see it hard, and I am stunned. I look at it until I act late. I use the knife very little. I have already solved it. Stand with the knife, look around for it, be complacent about it, and hide it with a good knife. ""Wen Huijun said: ""Goodness! When I heard what Pao Ding said, I have to keep in good health. "" "" ""The old man died, Qin lost his sorrow, and he came out on the third. The disciple said: ""Not a friend of the master?"" ""Yes."" ""But if this is enough?"" ""Yes. Shi Yewu?""

That's why he knows it, there must be no words, Those who do not cry but cry. It is to escape from the sky and to forget what it has suffered. The ancients called the punishment of escape from the sky. It is suitable to come, and the master is also; when it is suitable to go, the master is smooth.

The name is also the same; the one who knows is the weapon of competition. The two weapons are not so good. And the virtue is strong and trustworthy, it has not reached the popularity; the reputation is not disputed, and the reputation is not reached. Human heart. And the words of benevolence, righteousness, justice, and the predecessor of violence are to nurture their beauty from evil, and the fate is to call the person. If you are a person, you will be a person. If you are a person, you are a happy husband! But the evil is not good, and the evil is used to cultivate the difference?

I've read bits and pieces of this book hundreds 0f times, but until this week it had probably been close to 25 years since I sat down and read it straight through.A few weeks back, I read through ""Tao Teh Ching"" for the first time in a long time; again, I'd read this verse or that thousands of times, but it had been years since I sat and read it through.I read ""Tao Teh Ching"" a couple of weeks ago because in a world that seems to be coming undone in so many ways, I wanted something comfortable and grounding and familiar, wanted a reminder of some ""first principles,"" if you will. This reading of ""The Way of Chuang Tzu"" was more of that.Reading it again, I felt like I was seeing a friend that I'd been parted from for so long that I'd forgotten how much I missed them. It felt good to turn all these pages again. The book holds most of the magic for me at 46 that it held in my very early twenties; I'm older and (hopefully) wiser and I've seen much more, and so nothing thrills me with the ""newness"" that twenty-somethings feel, but the beauty and mystery is still there in these pages. Chuang Tzu (channeled through Merton) reminds us that the shit was build up around us-- the possessions we collect, the plans we make, the titles we hold, the ideas we're so damned proud of-- in the end don't amount to so much. I didn't know about Daniel Quinn or about Voluntary Simplicity when I read this 25 years ago, and was pleased to see much of what's here hitting on the best parts of those books and movements. Still my favorite bit-- one that I kept folded up in my wallet for many, many years-- is this:""The little marsh pheasantMust hop ten timesTo get a bit of grain.""She must run a hundred stepsBefore she takes a sip of water.Yet she does not askTo be kept in a hen runThough she might have all she desired Set before her.""She would rather runAnd seek her own little livingUncaged.""The wisdom of being useless. The wisdom of non-doing. The understanding that knowing what is enough means you will always have enough. The understanding that ""morality"" is only second-best to living in Tao. The sense that all that society deems so important is mostly just silliness that leads to heartache. It's all great.

Basically, I thought of it as a trifle. I flipped through it a few times, but mostly didn't read it once I realized from Merton's introduction that he was taking it more seriously than I was.Recently, after my father died, a friend sent to me one of the poems in this text. I'm going to include it:There were three friends Discussing life. One said:""Can men live together And know nothing of it? Work together And produce nothing? Can they fly around in space And forget to exist, World without end?""The three friends looked at each other And burst out laughing. They had no explanation. Thus they were better friends than before.Then one friend died. Confucius Sent a disciple to help the other two Chant his obsequies.The disciple found that one friend Had composed a song. While the other played a lute, They sang:""Hey, Sung Hu! Where'd you go? Hey, Sung Hu! Where'd you go? You have gone Where you really were. And we are here Damn it! We are here!""Then the disciple of Confucius burst in on them and Exclaimed: ""May I inquire where you found this in the Rubrics for obsequies, This frivolous carolling in the presence of the departed?""The two friends looked at each other and laughed: ""Poor fellow,"" they said, ""he doesn't know the new liturgy!""So, obviously, I had to actually read the book.

Not a translation; Merton states in his 'Note To The Reader' ""The texts ... assembled here ... have in time acquired a shape of their own and have become, as it were, 'imitations' of Chuang Tzu, or rather, free interpretative readings of characteristic passages which appeal especially to me.""Chuang Tzu [aka Zhuangzi] was a Taoist writer and philosopher who lived around the 4th century BC. Hence this book consists mainly of short essays and poems about how to live one's life, the meaning of life, the nature of good and evil, etc. Common themes for religious philosophy.At this point in my life I do not find these types of writing especially compelling, nor do I seek out literature in this genre. However I have decided to stick it out and read to the end, as it's not a particularly lengthy volume at 159 small formatted pages.My favorite quote, thus far, from p. 101: ""My opinion is that you never find happiness until you stop looking for it.""And thus, in this reader's opinion, the harder one looks for the Tao, the further it receeds. Hence, it's best not to waste time searching for it.

We've been reading such classics for generations; it's part of the cultural heritage of the area that received the ancient Chinese influence. In fact, the Japanese might read Chinese classics more than the Chinese today.) Chuang Tzu wrote extensively, so editors/translators must choose which stories to include in the book. I trust that this English translation contains his essential writings. Chuang Tzu defies definition. Yes, he was a Taoist. His thinking and writing are so limitless, however. Be mesmerized in the many imaginative stories and lose yourself. That's what these stories are ultimately about--to lose (or forget) the small self. Jesus taught by fables. I find it interesting that Chuang Tzu did something similar on the other side of the continent.

I stand there holding the knife and look all around me, completely satisfied and reluctant to move on, and then I wipe off the knife and put it away.""

Our deepest thoughts and considerations are almost always blocked by certain premises that we are unable to see through. Chuang Tzu escapes these barriers, in a thrilling and powerful way. At its basic level, The Way according to Chuang Tzu is not anchored in anything. Physical circumstance, metaphysical reality - these do not, well, MATTER. The Way is a philosophy that goes beyond all of this, rooted in nothing but the detached mind. There is no seeking, only understanding. There is no high, no low, only acceptance. It is a worldview as as expansive and daring as any other. That doesn't mean I'll be following this Way anytime soon - as thrilling as it is to mull over, its implications paint a picture of rather bleak and colorless detachment. Human suffering will not bring down the true Chuang Tzu sage, but neither will human celebration lift him up. Still, though, Chuang Tzu's writing will tune your mind, sift your preconceptions, ask you to release - just for a bit - whatever it is you hold as true and to simply THINK.And that is always a good thing.

I found this to be a nice discussion of Taoism, worlds easier to extract meaning from than the Tao Te Ching, though not quite as clear as the Tao of Pooh. It has all the trappings of ancient philosophy: parables, dialogues, and very poor logical constructions (though, unlike in Plato, these are essentially irrelevant for Zhuangzi; the point is never expressed in logical terms, but rather by illustration in analogy and parable). The parables are somewhat repetitious, both in tone and in ideas, and sometimes parables are explicitly repeated in slightly altered form. They express three central ideas:1. That Virtue (happiness, lack of suffering, contentment) is to be found in a middle way, which makes no pretense to glory, riches, or power, nor to asceticism or isolation. It advocates acceptance of your lot in life as the truest road to happiness.2. That fate is the ultimate determinant of the life you live. You are given a body, a society, a mind, etc, which all conspire to make you who you are and make you do what you do. 3. That all divisions of the world and experience into categories are fallacious and indeed the source of all discontent. This means that language and thought themselves are facetious and don't necessarily have anything to do with the objective universe, and that the only way to truly understand is to abandon all attempts to understand. These ideas are pretty damned nice for a philosopher who thought such a long time ago. They're not perfect, of course, but I'd say it is probably worth reading. Maybe not. I dunno. Definitely read the Tao of Pooh over Zhuangzi, I'd say, but maybe complement them with each other.This translation has a nice straightforward character, in that the translator provides many footnotes that are up front about the fact that in many places he didn't really know what Zhuangzi was trying to say. This makes it easier to find the spots that aren't worth trying to parse, since he points them out as dubiously translated and maintained from the original. ""Words exist because of meaning; once you've gotten the meaning, you can forget the words. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words so I can have a word with him?""

But once you get into it and understand it intuitively, its stories and principles about the ""Dao"" or the flow of nature, will just begin to make sense to you. That said, sometimes, you'll still want to put your head down and cry from baffled confusion, but overall, it's a good read that leaves you with a greater sense of connection to the world and nature and Daoism.

Zhuangzi has been labeled a ""Taoist"" since the 2nd century B.C., but what the hell does that mean? Sima Qian started this whole thing of calling Laozi and Zhuangzi ""Taoists"", like they shared the same world view and argued the same ideas. Wrong!

Zhuangzi has been labeled a ""Taoist"" since the 2nd century B.C., but what the hell does that mean? Sima Qian started this whole thing of calling Laozi and Zhuangzi ""Taoists"", like they shared the same world view and argued the same ideas. Wrong! Laozi and Zhuangzi really need to be taken as separate representations of different ways of thought, distinct not only from each other but from the wave of ""Confucians"" (another label courtesy of Sima Qian in the 2nd century BC) to come after Confucius himself.Zhuangzi was a contemporary of Mencius. He probably lived in the state of Song, where the exiled Shang clans were allowed by their Zhou conquerers to quietly carry out their sacrifices to their ancestors under careful scrutiny. In a way, we might say a glimmer of Shang cultural values is coming through in Zhuangzi's writings, which are so characteristically different from the Zhou inspired Confucian thinkers.Regardless, Zhuangzi doesn't like utility. He doesn't like language, but is a master of its use. He never offers solutions to problems, he only hints at them. He's a performer and a trickster, and so hard to figure out what the hell he's getting at.But what he seems to be saying is that maybe the only things in life worth knowing are ineffable. How can you ultimately ""know"" something? And as soon as you put what you know into action, you immediately limit other possibilities. Zhuangzi wants to leave you in a state of uncertainty, in a state where you're open to any number of possibilities. If he instead provided answers and solid explanations, the power of potential would be cut off. You might think these answers would provide stability, but for Zhuangzi what is lost by the provision of answers is no stability at all. For Zhuangzi, the only way to answer questions is to shift between them, to wander in the realization of the myriad explanations for any question. And therein is power and wisdom - not in assigning names or defining hierarchies or learning the Rites or in learning how to be a gentleman.These are more of my lecture notes from class discussions of the ""100 schools"" that are helpful to reflect on if ever you read this book (or re-read it, as the case may be). My one big suggestion if you read Zhuangzi (or any of these books really): Take them on their own terms and try hard to separate what the author is trying to say from all that over 2000 years of other people have said about what the author is trying to say. It's a hard thing to do, but very rewarding if you can do it!

This is a collection of his writings, not the entire surviving corpus.Burton Watson, the translator, provides an excellent overview of the early history of Taoism and the place of these writings in it. Still, it was hard for me to make sense of. This is a book that requires serious study to make sense of--not just because it has become a religious text, but its antiquity and its context in a very long-ago and foreign culture, it reminded me of reading the old Testament.Except there's even less of a story. What are provided here are fragments. They are grouped into chapters, but I wondered how these groupings were achieved in many cases. The last two, when the writer spoke most directly to the reader, were the most consistent and easy to understand. Otherwise, a lot of the time I was reading this I wondered if it could be classified as a book at all--indeed, it made me wonder how things get contained as and called a book.Which, I suppose, is part of Chung-Tzu's point--though not one he was trying to make. Certainly he is at pains to question the very notion of categories--good, bad, etc. There's the famous part where he dreamed he was a butterfly and, upon waking, wondered if he wasn't a butterfly dreaming he was a man. And the other famous part wondering about how one can know what fish feel.But lots of other parts are much more pedantic, about being the good kind of ruler, or the good kind of person, which has some relationship to the Tao, but, to me at least, this relationship was never clear.Lao-Tzu can continue to be read because his best translators (re)create a lapidary language. The sections are free-form poetry; there is a philosophy developed, and consistent themes across them.I could not see those here for being too confused by the details. Though Burton provides footnotes explaining who certain people are, it is still too distant, too intellectual an exercise. Besides, a bunch of the footnotes make clear that the original text is confusing even to Burton and other commentators, making meaning even that much more distant.

Chuang Tzu is a book on Taoist philosophy. This particular translation is part of the Basic Writing series from Burton Watson.  The introduction written by him advises the reader against systematic analysis of the work itself because it is a mystic text. It is not to be analyzed and studied but reflected upon and understood. I agree with him.  Looking for meaning in each line, paragraph, page etc. is bound to be frustrating. I don't see it as written that way. It's more of gestalt sort of thing.

I agree with him.  Looking for meaning in each line, paragraph, page etc. is bound to be frustrating. I don't see it as written that way. It's more of gestalt sort of thing. You have to read it with an open mind, without preconceptions, to get anything.  For me, personally, it resembles some of the martial art books that I've read. I see themes of the empty mind, value of intuition/muscle memory and the importance of detachment and focus.  It's been kind of hard to write this review because of the nature of the wisdom in this book. It frequently makes light of language itself by calling it ""reckless"" or otherwise insufficient in explaining The Way. At one point, Chuang Tzu even says that once you understand the meaning of his words you can and should forget the words themselves. So while I wrote this review I felt like I failed to really talk about the book at all. It's more like what I thought about the book which might be completely off-base.  I like this book but for some reason I don't feel like giving it an ""A"". Perhaps it is because some of the passages feel like nonsense. The introduction mentioned that some of the text was difficult to translate, corrupted, or something like that. It also mentioned how some of the historical text feels like it was written by a different person with less skill but that he tried to remove as much of that as possible. Although this particular copy has scribbled notes from its previous owner which function as a contrasting viewpoint, which is helpful.  Trickster Eric Novels gives ""Chaung Tzu"" a B+

Zhuangzi's way of portraying to the reader what life would be like if they were as free spirited as he was, made me really wonder. Zhuangzis uses this book to show different ways of Daoism and truly believes in his ethics. ""When you haven’t yet settled what’s within you yourself, what leisure have you to concern yourself with the conduct of tyrant?"" This is an example that really hit me. It is true that people are at times very opinionated, while the judgement they are giving is something they haven't fixed within themselves. Zhuangzi's way of showing he was a simple man, was by simply shedding light on how presented himself, ripped clothing, shoes, and portraying an image of a homeless man. This in his stories showed me that he was a man who lived his life in his way, he was not a clone of someone. He was simply himself! ""This turtle, now, would it prefer to be dead with its bones preserved and honored, or to be alive with its tail dragging in the mud?” “Alive with its tail dragging in the mud,” answered the two officials. “Then go away,” said Zhuangzi. “I mean to drag my tail in the mud!” This quote in his story shows that no matter what importance of character the people approaching him were, he was just a man who was trying to live his life; in regards to what he knew. Which was simply enjoying his time on Earth. (268)

But things including our desires are themselves nothings. - In the world where Buddhism is widespread and people are kind to each other, the religion will be that of killers.- Since everything is nothing, nothing exists without its opposite. - We are absolutely free, but at the same time, absolutely connected. - We are perfect.

I liked the Tao Te Ching better, but then I realized that until I could rid myself of the sentiment of thinking that my relative like or dislike of the two books was important, I certainly could not claim to have absorbed the teachings of the Tao. This book is a beautiful, complex and infuriating poem, which uses repetition, contradiction, and a structure like a Jackson Pollack painting to develop its themes in a way that simple explication could not do. The Tao is everything and everywhere (also nothing and nowhere) and is therefore mindfully embedded in every part of the form, words, stories, characters, themes and structures of this book. It is an incredible achievement of beauty and style that works on several different levels as a teaching tool. It is also sometimes irritating, hard to read and seemingly pointless, but that in itself is at least part of the point. And like the Tao Te Ching, this is a book that could stand up under many readings. It would show itself differently each time. For that reason it could easily go on a list of ten books that I would take with me to a desert island.

Lao Tzu turned me onto a new way of contemplating reality and human nature, but Chuang tzu made it possible for me to make the ideas a part of who I am..similarly Rumi showed me that love and treating the divine as precious were not antithetical to my atheism/agnosticism.

There are amusing tales and beautiful depictions. One of the most famous is when Chuang Tzu questions whether he is a man dreaming he is a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming he is a man.

Both are wonderful ways of communicating the Taoist principles, both are books which I can always return to in times when I lose the way. One particular thing I love about the writings of Zhuangzi is the humor- a key element for my practice of this kind of philosophy... not just accepting the world, but getting to laugh along with it's absurdities.

Perhaps more a 3.5, but I'd feel weird. & of course, texts such as this deserve deep & multiple readings. Some parts I found very repetitive - at first I thought it was because I was dying & couldn't understand. But it happened consistently & in a recognisable pattern, so I think it is indeed repetitive. But what do I know? I am a young trout swimming upstream in the blood of my parents & my parents' parents. For now, time is my teacher.

 ""Is the man dreaming of the butterfly, or is the butterfly dreaming of the man?""  With questions like this, Chaung Tzu proves himself to be every bit of Lao Tzu's disciple. Interesting to note that Chuang Tzu essentially had bits of solipsism in his work thousands of years before Westerners like T.S. Eliot incorporated it into works like ""The Wasteland"". Daoism is still my favourite philosophy.

As translated ancient Asian texts go, this is a nice little work. This was published in 1964 and while compared to the 2300 year history of the works this is nothing, I'm sure there are more modern interpretations that might be of some use to casual readers. The introduction is excellent and the footnotes are very helpful in attempting to understand (where possible, it's not always!) the probable meaning of some of the allegorical stories.

The amount of parallels with the Islamic traditions, especially Sufi ones, which does raise the question of the interplay between the two traditions, more explicitly analyzed by Toshihiko Izutsu. The literary stylistics also share a great parallel with much of Islamic religious texts, hence, it didn't feel that strange reading the text.

There's a definite poetic logic at work in how shorter, unrelated (and sometimes inane) seeming anecdotes are juxtaposed. That's to say, in order to reveal the radically simple, Chuang Tzu utilizes wonderfully complex/diverse strategies.

The basic writings (also called the inner chapters or writings) represent those that are attributable to Zhuangzi the person. The later or outer chapters are under dispute as to authorship but decidedly follow the direction set by Zhuangzi.

Here's an almost random collection of ideas exploring how one should conceive of and live in the world: seek understanding but don't rely on traditional knowledge (there's a knowledge that does not know); be constant in a world that is constantly changing or be ever changing in a world that is constant; being useless might be useful; etc. Much of the text is designed to simply jar the reader out of their normal way of thinking.

Like this one:""Someone in Sung had some marvelous hats to sell, so he took them to Yueh. But the Yueh tribes crop their hair short and tattoo their bodies: they had no use for marvelous hats.""That's my kind of tale. Later, Chuang Tzu chastises his friend, calling him a fool and a buffoon, for eating an oversized gourd, instead of using it as a boat to drift down the river. Many of the stories go something like this:A middling sage with a name like Adept Watershed approaches either Chuang Tzu or Confucius and gets told off for not being sage enough.Or:Three sages who are friends, let's say Adept Horsehouse, Adept Woodfarm, and Adept Kung behave towards each other in some way that others don't understand, but is actually good, for some reason.Or something like that. It's funny, but also, in a way that I am not making clear in this review, it makes you think. I'd recommend reading the Tao Te Ching first, so you have context for what kind of lessons are being taught here.

In particular, being somewhat familiar with 'Dao De Jing', I found the many references to ""Heaven and Earth"" in Chuang-Tzu confusing. Heaven seemed to have assumed the role of the Dao in much of the text. I am really unclear as to the relationship of the two concepts here in a way that I am not in 'DDJ'.-I was most impressed by Graham's introductory notes which give a good sense of where Chuang-Tzu is coming from. Simultaneously, I read Graham's section on Chuang-Tzu in his 'Disputers of the Tao' for added understanding.-Over all, I appreciated the textual notes which added yet greater clarity to the text. I would have appreciated more information on translation however. The 'List of Characters' at the back would be helpful if the characters appeared in the text, but they don't. It would also have been helpful if he had cited translation issues in the text.

Who knows if it was Chuang Tzu dreaming a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming Chuang Tzu?"" -- Chapter 2, Chuang Tzu: The Inner ChaptersChuang Tzu: The Inner Chapters is a collection of parables believed to have been written by the Taoist teacher Chuang Tzu during the 4th century BCE. This work, along with the Tao Te Ching of Lao Tzu, is considered to be the framework over which the philosophy of Taoism developed. Parables tend to be enigmatic at the best of times and this collection, written not only centuries but millennia ago, is no exception. This isn't a work to be read once and then put aside. These stories will send you off down a path you didn't intend to follow and then bring you back where you started, with the story itself. I found reading this overview of Chuang Tzu from the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, in conjunction with the text, to be very helpful.This was my first time reading Chuang Tzu: The Inner Chapters and I still haven't tried the Outer Chapters or the Mixed Chapters. I'm sure I'll be coming back to these stories again, and probably coming away with something different each time.

Chuang Tsu is a primary articulator of early Taoist philosophy. This is my first exposure to his writings. Initially, and for now, I am drawn more to Lao Tsu’s aphoristic style, insights and emphasis. Some of this writing I like a lot. The interconnectedness of things, the power relationships between them and the balance point in those relationships, are conveyed in passages such as this: “When there is no more separation between ‘this’ and ‘that,’ it is called the still-point of Tao.

Chuang Tsu is a primary articulator of early Taoist philosophy. This is my first exposure to his writings. Initially, and for now, I am drawn more to Lao Tsu’s aphoristic style, insights and emphasis. Some of this writing I like a lot. The interconnectedness of things, the power relationships between them and the balance point in those relationships, are conveyed in passages such as this: “When there is no more separation between ‘this’ and ‘that,’ it is called the still-point of Tao. At the still-point in the center of the circle one can see the infinite in all things.” The ebb and flow of energy comes through with this: “When there is separation, there is coming together. When there is coming together, there is dissolution.” Merging into the background, and going with the flow rather than standing out, is a prudent survival strategy, as conveyed by this: “I have been trying for a long time to be useless,” and this: “When I say he has no desire,” Chuang Tsu says, “I mean that he does not disturb his inner well-being with likes and dislikes. He accepts things as they are and does not try to improve upon them.” Chuang Tsu writes of the true man: “Carefree he went. Carefree he came. That was all.” That man accepts “what he was given with delight, and when it was gone, he gave it no more thought. This is called not using the mind against Tao and not using man to help heaven.” As the introduction suggests (these writings are an anticipation of Zen Buddhism and a “laying of the foundation for a state of emptiness or ego transcendence”), the “Inner Chapters” also seem to transition into something other than what is seen in Tao Te Ching. For example, speaking of a Tao sage who, having transcended “the physical world,” and “all material existence,” and, having seen the One, he began to transcend the distinction of past and present…to enter the land where there is no life or death, where killing does not take away life and giving birth does not add to it.” In another passage, Yen Hui, a Taoist seeker, says: “‘I am not attached to the body and I give up any idea of knowing. By freeing myself from the body and mind, I become one with the infinite. This is what I mean by sitting and forgetting.”’ Right or wrong, in this first reading I sensed a tension in the “Inner Chapters” between a Tao as an impersonal energy stream that one learns to adjust to and work with in a cosmos where there is nothing beyond death, and a Tao as an eternal reality that one can merge with and, thereby, and in that way, live forever.

Daoism as Zhuangzi sees it would clearly relieve you of all anxiety, plus you'd be like... on to ""it"".Of course, that seems kind of paradoxical.. how can there be ""a"" way. a ""the"" way. How can you ever leave the way.So Zhuangzi gets all Catholic about it and talks about the kind of knowing and acting that a person who is so long practiced at something they no longer think about it but simply do and do it perfectly. Ok... how do we get there oh wise one? and to this, dude who may never have existed and even if he did all we have is some really messed up writings that are older than the bible.. well he doesn't tell you. Not really.In the end, Zhuangzi is like a jump into a cold pool from the sauna of your life. I think it's less important what he's trying to say, if he's trying to say anything, and more important what it makes you think about.but that's true of just about everything by my philosophy...why are you reading a review of a book anyway?

This book contains what are known as the seven ""Inner Chapters"" of his teaching—that part of his work which is acknowledged by scholars as having definitely been written by him. Chuang Tsu developed the doctrines of Taoism with rigorous logic. His fables and humor are imaginative and poetic, reflecting a brilliant and original mind. He advocated relativity with regard to all standards and values. He was at once a mystic and a revolutionary. The rhythm of life and its organic vision, an idea poetically implied by Lao Tsu, is brought to perfect expression in the writings of Chuang Tsu.Very little is known about Chuang Tsu and that little is inextricably woven into legend. While the other philosophers were busying themselves with the practical matters of government and rules of conduct, Chuang Tsu transcended the whang cheng, the illusory dust of the world—thus anticipating Zen Buddhism's emphasis on a state of emptiness or ego transcendence. With humor, imagery and fantasy, he captures the depth of Chinese thinking.

Zhuangzi (and the anonymous writers) talk about and poke fun at different philosophers and ideas of the time.

Some of the most memorable passages have Confucious, probably the most praised philosopher and statesman in chinese history, being portrayed as an arrogant fool. Someone obsessed by rituals and meaningless things, he's too distracted acquiring knowledge and bossing people around, he clearly doesn't know the Way. Burton Watson's notes are valuable for explaining and making clear certain sentences and passages in the work.

I've felt for a long time that I had some affinity with Daoist ideas--mostly from reading Dao De Jing, Smullyan's ""The Tao is Silent,"" and Le Guin's ""The Lathe of Heaven."" I'm drawn to the attitude, similar to Hellenistic Skepticism, of withholding judgment on things going on around you, and I like the gentle but pronounced disdain for those things often held in esteem by the world--again something Daoism has in common with some Hellenistic philosophies. And, I had heard over and over that Zhuangzi was the earthier cousin of the gnomic Dao De Jing. I'm sad to say that this whole book felt like a slog for me. I would have quit partway through if it weren't so widely seen as a classic. It's possible some of the blame is with the translation--it was hard for me to get a sense of what people thought of different translations, so I went for a safe choice with the Penguin edition. It's possible a different translator could do more to bring it alive for me. It's also very likely that some of the blame lies with me, and in particular, with my insistence on reading it cover-to-cover rather than keeping it around as something to dip into once in a while. But I also think some of the fault comes from the text itself. With a couple of rare exceptions, I didn't find the ""stories"" in it to be earthy or accessible--indeed, I'd hardly characterize them as stories at all. A typical passage just involves a dialog between two characters where some ideas of Daoism are touched upon. Of course a dialog can be a great literary form, but I found these pieces too fragmentary to really develop ideas. (Perhaps that is just a non-Daoist form of communication!) But at the same time, they weren't at all memorable parable-type stories. About a month after having finished the book, it's hard for me to remember many specific stories from it.So, I don't know. Four stars for the ideas, but two stars for the style, maybe? The most memorable idea for me, which reappears often in slightly different forms, is the following. Things that are ""useful"", particularly exemplary individuals of a certain form, are the first to be destroyed, while weak or flawed individuals are more likely to be left alone. For example, a woodcutter going into a forest is likely to seek out the tallest, straightest tree and cut it down. So although we would commonly call this the ""best"" tree, it's certainly not best for the tree! At first the ""moral"" of this story might seem obvious, but I think it's actually pretty subtle and difficult to pin down, and therefore fruitful. For example, occasionally this story will be accompanied by a side comment that, actually, the ""worst"" instances are also likely to be destroyed (because they are wasting space or whatever)! So it's not as though there's some simple moral like ""be a slacker."" For me, these stories are meant to get the reader thinking critically about our concept of ""usefulness,"" and what classes of things we do or don't apply it to. There's actually quite a bit of resonance with some of the ideas in Jemisin's ""The Stone Sky,"" where she introduces but then subtly problematizes a civilization that is built around the channeling of biological energy, and the dichotomy of reverence and instrumentalization.

His prose is playful. His wit is charming. His satire of Confucianism and Legalism is not overly bitter. And he’s not as mystical as Lao Tzu, which makes his writing more accessible. Still, I should’ve gone with the inner chapters, but my pride got the better of me and I opted for the complete works instead. Did I regret this decision? At times, especially when I was inundated with chapters and stories that even the commentators can’t comprehend.

Chuang Tzu was, with Lao Tzu, one of the main thinkers of Taoism. If Lao Tzu left us the Tao Te Ching, a poetical collection of verses, beautiful but, honestly, at time quite difficult to fully get, Chuang Tzu deepen his philosophy by taking a completely different approach: gathering stories and anecdotes portraying a whole set of historical or fictional characters, so as to shape a funny, original, and subversive anthology. The Butterfly Dream, the metaphor of the frog trapped in a well... They are all in here! Sure, scholars still quarrel in between themselves deciding which tales were actually written by him and which ones by his disciples. But who cares? They read as a whole, and their messages won't fail to strike a few chords. He obviously defends the three golden treasures (humility, simplicity, compassion). He invites us to let go, guided by the Tao yet aware of everything that could threaten our internal peace and happiness. He, above all, goes even further; by rejecting those 'intellectualising' the Tao, these scholars of the Hundred Schools that he accuses of overcomplicating it all and so confusing us. Confucius, especially, gets his fare share of criticism! Chaung Tzu indeed had no patience for conventions and rituals, that he thoughts were killing off spontaneity and freedom. Obviously, as an Ancient text it has its fair share of misguided outlook. For instance, he believed mankind to be born with the Skies and Earth, and so man to be naturally good and perfectly capable to live in full harmony with a supposed compassionate environment. Yet, it can also be strikingly insightful; as when he laughs at our arrogance in defining ourselves as the pinacle of Creation, mocking by the same token our constant and silly anthropocentrism when looking at the world. You get it: there are in here some lessons for everyone... Radical, funny and sharp, these little stories surely are provocative. Here's a witty collection that deserves to be discovered!

This may not be such a defect for those in the West who are using the book purely for scholarly or personal reasons, however try speaking with any Wade-Giles word the way it is phonetically rendered to a Chinese person, and you will not be understood.Essentially, Daoism is an ascetic philosophy (or religion, depending on one's definition) and this book (the second most important after Tao Te Ching) is perhaps a better introduction to Daoism, and lays out the essentially ascetic philosophy of personal contentment, adaptation and harmony.By no means an easy read, and a book that needs revisiting, and re-examining, but a very good book for those who want to further understand Daoism, or Chinese thinking in general.Note however that the Daoist school of thought is very different, and in many ways, at odds with the Legalist school of thought (Confucius, Mencius) and as such gives one a different view of Chinese philosophy than the over reaching and all encompassing Confucian societal structure. However, essential reading for those who wish to understand the more spiritual aspects of Chinese thought.

“Understanding is not understanding” (302): such is Chaung Tzu’s flavour of scepticism.

One might also say it goes far beyond what is healthy: when someone says a thing like, “It is dangerous to use any of your faculties” (222), it’s hard not to cry paranoia. Knowledge, to Chuang Tzu, seems to be by definition a deception. And yet: it’s also hard to say that Chaung Tzu is deceiving himself. The question, “is it knowledge knowledge?” has never been asked in so clear headed (and so entertaining) a way: “Everything in the world knows how to seek for knowledge that they do not have, but do not know how to find what they already know... This is what causes such immense confusion” (80). So, Chuang Tzu is calling knowledge a succubus. But before we say that it's only because he's jealous she's teasing you and not himself, consider: could not it rather be that he sees so clearly the glorious thing she is tempting us away from?Myself, I can't see it so clearly; but I can see that Chuang Tzu does--and that's why I love this book; even if you don't get ""the Tao"", you get to spend time with a great mind. “One whose inner being is fixed upon such greatness emits a Heavenly glow” (203), he writes. The glow is here. It overflows, spills over you: I could not read more than a few pages at a time before getting the sense that it was useless to read more. It's not like philosophy, in which a concept is grasped or not-grasped; this is a different beast. To read this book over the course of six months, keeping it always by my bedside for nights of insomnia and mornings of contemplation, has been one of the wilder experiences of my life.

He ran and ran until he could not run any longer, his death. How far are we different from him? We have long been educated, cultured, doctrinated to have judgement and preference for whatever that can be dichotomied: light and darkness, good and evil, unsavory and delicious, poor and rich, low and high status .... the list can go on and on.

The book that bears Chuang Tzu’s name was probably not all written by Chuang Tzu – chances are that it is something of a compilation, put together at least in part by a number of the great man’s disciples – but it is unquestionably Chuang Tzu’s book, and it is one of the seminal works of classical Chinese philosophy.The name of Chuang Tzu might better be rendered as Zhuang Zhou, 莊子. But however one transliterates his name, he is one of the most important philosophers who ever lived. Living and writing in the 4th century B.C., amidst the instability and chaos of China's Warring States period, Chuang Tzu identified with the Taoist school of philosophy, as originally set forth by Lao Tzu in the Tao Te Ching. The contrast between Taoist philosophy on the one hand, and that of Confucius on the other, is a stark one. Confucianism emphasizes reverence for social institutions, from family to empire; Taoist thinking, by contrast, emphasizes the importance of finding a path of one’s own, questioning social norms in order to find what may be wrong with them. 2,200 years before Rousseau, Taoist thinkers like Chuang Tzu were asking why humankind is born free but is everywhere in chains.A first-time reader of The Book of Chuang Tzu will no doubt be impressed with the sheer playfulness of much of the book. In one of the book’s most famous passages, Chuang Tzu uses the metaphor of a butterfly to pose complex philosophical questions about being and identity:“Once upon a time, I, Chuang Tzu, dreamt that I was a butterfly, flitting around and enjoying myself. I had no idea I was Chuang Tzu. Then suddenly I woke up and was Chuang Tzu again. But I could not tell, had I been Chuang Tzu dreaming I was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming I was now Chuang Tzu? However, there must be some sort of difference between Chuang Tzu and a butterfly! This is what we call the transformation of things.” (p. 20)Here, one detects echoes of Platonic ideas regarding the potential unreliability of the evidence of the senses. Inspiring to reflect that in Greece and China, at about the same time in history, great thinkers were grappling with these same basic philosophical questions.In contrast with the emphasis in Confucianism on how reverence for social institutions can help one to move up in the social hierarchy, to become a “gentleman” or a “great man” rather than a “small man,” the philosophy of the Tao encourages its practitioner to accept what happens in a spirit of serenity – in a manner similar to later Roman Stoic philosophers like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. One story from The Book of Chuang Tzu illustrates this “go with the flow” principle particularly well. Chuang Tzu describes how Chin Shih, a follower of Lao Tzu, did not engage in formal mourning when Lao Tzu died, but rather simply issued three great shouts and then left. Asked for a reason for the absence of formal mourning, Chin Shih said, “When the Master came, it was because he was due to be born. When he died, it was entirely natural. If you are prepared to accept this and flow with it, then sorrow and joy cannot touch you. The ancient ones considered this the work of the gods who free us from bondage” (p. 24).Confucius puts in a few appearances in The Book of Chuang Tzu, but usually as a bit of a foil – as when Confucius, appearing before a Taoist teacher named Lao Lai Tzu (not the Lao Tzu who wrote the Tao Te Ching, is promptly rebuked: “Confucius! Rid yourself of your pride and that smug look on your face and you could then become a nobleman” (p. 239). Lao Tai Tzu criticizes Confucius for overemphasizing human agency and the pursuit of material prosperity: “You insist that people should only be joyful in a way you prescribe” (p. 239).Elsewhere in The Book of Chuang Tzu, Confucius, in dialogue with Lao Tzu (this time, the author of the Tao Te Ching), is told that his seventeen years of determined effort to find the Tao have been unavailing because “If the Tao could be served up, everyone would serve it up to their lords” (p. 122). This same idea regarding the search for the Tao is re-emphasized when the Taoist teacher Yen Kang Tiao says of the Tao that “You can look for it but it has no shape. You can listen for it, but it has no voice….To talk of the Tao is not to know the Tao” (pp. 194-95).The Tao emerges as a vital, the vital, life principle – something that any true human being should seek to understand. Late in The Book of Chuang Tzu, Confucius – who, by this point in the book, fortunately seems to have learned something – tells his disciple Tzu Lu that “the Tao is that by which all the forms of life have life. All that lose it die. All that obtain it live. To struggle against it in practice is to face ruin. To flow with it is to succeed” (p. 286). One cannot strike out on a grand expedition to find the Tao; one can only try to make oneself ready to receive it. The Tao, ultimately, seems to have something in common with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle – the idea that one can measure either the position or the velocity of a subatomic particle, but not both. The more that one tries to grab onto and ""master"" the Tao, the further one will be from the Tao. Devotion to things like money, fame, and power, for example, will make it impossible for one to find the Tao: “Someone who believes wealth is the most important thing cannot give up their income; someone who seeks pre-eminence cannot give up the hunt for fame; those who love power cannot hand it over to others. Those who cling to things like these are usually fearful” (p. 123). Finding the Tao seems to involve losing the things that most people in any society consider important.I read The Book of Chuang Tzu while traveling in Hangzhou, China. Walking along the shore of the city’s beautiful West Lake, I imagined how Chinese people living through the turbulence of the Warring States period might have taken comfort from the words of Chuang Tzu, as the fortunes of the various warring states waxed and waned. This state or that state, a reader of Chuang Tzu might reflect, may rise or fall; but West Lake will remain: the beauty of the lake and its landscape and wildlife will abide. That philosophy of calm acceptance of what is, because it is, poses an existential challenge to all those would-be conquerors of worlds who are to be found in every society. Many people of modern times, trying ever harder to grab and hold onto an ever-larger piece of the proverbial pie, might benefit from considering Chuang Tzu’s advice: let go of what does not matter, in order to find what does.

I'm no scholar of East Asian or Chinese philosophy, though at one time I thought I would become such. What I did was become someone who has enough familiarity with Confucian thought, particular as it applies to social and political matters, to have been able to publish a couple of scholarly articles on the topic, do a few reviews of academic publications on the topic, and get invited to a few conferences in China. I'm lucky in all those regards, but my gaps of knowledge when it comes to the philosophical traditions I'm looking at remain large. And so it is that I've actually read the the writings attributed to Zhuangzi (or Chuang Tzu), one of the most important Daoist texts of all time. This fall, for three weeks, I was able to dive into those writings, in conjunction with a study group here at Friends University. It was a fascinating several hours, spread out over three meetings, in which we found ourselves trying to grasp, as best we could, Zhuanzhi's elusive descriptions of the Dao. It reminded me frequently of the writings of certain German romantic and hermeneutic thinkers, particularly Heidegger, who similarly gestured in at least some of his writings at the idea that being is a given thing, a revealed thing, but never in any sense a static or name-able thing, and thus struggled to work out how being relates to language, knowledge, and practice. There were many wonderful, challenging passages, which invited us to contemplate how the particular instance of things is, in itself, a revelation of the universal, whereas an attempt to define or situate oneself in relation to a (invariably static) universal can only lead one any from the Dao. Anyway, fun stuff--not something I'm ever going to become a scholar of, but something I'm very glad I read. Here's one passage worth remembering:""The dao has no boundaries; speech has no fixed form. Because of this, there arose demarcations. Let me describe the demarcations. They are the rights and the left, discussions and theories, classifications and distinctions, and agreements and contentions. These are called the eight characteristics. What is beyond the world the sage sets aside with no discussion. What is within the world the sage discusses but forms no judgments....Where there is discussion for the people, there could be no discussion for the sage. How so? The sage keeps his views to himself whereas men generally display theirs in disputation. Hence we have the saying, 'Disputation is a sign of not seeing clearly'"" (Book 2, ""The Equality of All Things"").

The people living them are usually really living a complex synthesis of the better parts of scripture mixed with broadly pro-scial stuff that makes sense. The whacko puritans you see acting like loons are usually people who have actually read the books all the way through and are following them exactly.I like the stuff about darkness. I like darkness generally as a theme. It feels true to me and more true when talking about deep things.When I imagine the darkness of Taoism I think of it as akin to the darkness of my own mind in the moments before an idea or perception brings itself into focus or allows itself into being.When I try to trace back the originating influences for an idea, I often find some of them, traces in the world. But I can't find all of them, and I can never 'see' an idea before it exists. It is like the explosive ignition of a firework. It cannot be observed directly. As soon as its effects come into play they expand outward through the neural nets, forming connections and inferences, but the original moment is something that must happen in timeless darkness, unmeasured.Because I spend a lot of time making things up, I spend a lot of time essentially praying to darkness. Or at least, waiting. Paused with a pen and a blank pad and nothing on my mind, trying to hold the elements of a problem in my mind but without actualy focusing on the solution. Present but not present. Waiting for something....The irony of a man obsessed with books, discussing a book in which a central concept is that knowledge from books should not be respected, online, via a textual medium, is far from lost on me.Still, the wheelwright is right. Books, and words generally, are delusions, or just a kind of arrant prorgramme running over the texture of reality, like a bug running over a cake. They are not things you should believe in, certainly not things you should treat as absolute.Whether I stand any chance of applying this wisdom to my own life; probably not. I would have to say I have failed, and am failing, in my war, with words, against words. The words are winning....I like its attitude towards people and the public, which seems ever more meaningful today as we live in our infinite maze of glass. There is no way out of it. Trying to be special only highlights the ways in which you are like everyone else. We are all out here posting our travel pics, trying to be unique in exactly the same ways. Why bother. There is simply no escape from the trap of a desire for regard or of a relationship with public opinion. How can any of us get away from it? The public eye is right there, can we ever not dance for it? If we make a big fuss about not dancing for it then we are still dancing for it, just in a different way. It is a labyrinth of mirrors and since there is no exit we may as well just breathe deeply and close our eyes....Why ask me? Product of things I cannot see and do not understand, ending for reasons I can barely percieve, lasting as long as I last and following rules most of which I can also not see. Why ask me indeed.And I like this bit on taking action from 'The Old Fisherman'...Confucius looked sad and sighed, bowed twice, stood up and said, 'Lu has exiled me twice, I have fled from Wei, they have felled a tree on me in Sung and laid siege to me between Chen and Tsai. I have no idea what I did to be so misunderstood. Why was I subject to these four forms of trouble?The stranger looked distressed, then his expression changed and he said, ' It is very difficult, Sir, to make you understand! There was once a man who was frightened by his own shadow and scared of his own footprints, so he tried to escape them by running away. But every time he lifted his foot and brought it down, he made more footprints, and no matter how fast he ran, his shadow never left him. Thinking he was running too slowly, he ran faster, never ceasing until finally he exhausted himself and collapsed and died. he had no idea that by simply sitting in the shade he would have lost his shadow, nor that by resting quietly he would cease making footprints. He really was a great fool!...Although I think I also disagree with it. You might say I both agree and disagree with it, which doesn't seem to be a big problem with Taoism which loves paradox and uncertainty.I do think Taoism on politics is interesting interesting and should be taken into consideration.Bluntly - try hard not to do anything, and if you can't avoid doing anything, then try to do as little as possible, or at least, don't shove or warp things out of the way they are already going to go.There seems to be a difference between what I seem to read in actual (translated) Taoist texts and Western interpretations of them.The originals seem really, deeply, obsessively moraly neutral and non-interventionist. If we are to follow them as they are written, then it looks like most good works are just out the window.There is nothing outside the Tao, and this must apply to very bad things as it does to very bad things. Like in this bit from 'The Shores of Dark Waters';...""Master Tung Kuo asked Chuang Tzu, 'That which is called the Tao, where is it?Chuang Tzu replied, 'There is nowhere where it is not.''But give me a specific example.''In this ant,' said Chuang Tzu.'Is that its lowest point?''In this panic grass,' said Chuang Tzu.'Can you give me a lower example?''In this common earthenware tile,' said Chuang Tzu.'This must be its lowest point!''It's in shit and piss too,' said Chuang Tzu.""...So it must be in rape and earthquakes, murder and mutilation, humiliation, pain, loss and ruin also. After all, it is the Tao, it cannot help but be in those things.The two ways in which people seem to try to square this circle are the idea of 'essential nature' in the Book of Chuang Tzu, which is broadly a primitivist but slightly positive view in which things only go really badly in nature and between people if people stop following their essential nature. But if we all went and lived on communes or something then all this bad stuff just wouldn't happen.I don't think this is true. I think that all the way from Chimps to Neolithic Hunter Gatherers to Nation States, these 'negative' or undesired elements have been there. So either there is an essential nature to humanity and it includes a lot of bad shit, or there is no essential nature.True, the book of Chuang Tzu doesn't directly tell us that this stuff will stop happening if we all become Taoists and follow our essential nature, it just somewhat glides around the issue.The Westeners, from what I can see, are basically following broadly pro-social Abrahamic/Greek ethics from Jesus, Aristotle and their own lived experience and using Taoism as a kind of contrast or investigative polarity to that, and just calling that Taoism.Which I think is actually probably a pretty good idea. It's just theoretically stupid, and not what it says on the box, but it does actually work so I can hardly complain too much.But it is not what it says on the box. It's really, deeply obscure, and very untrusting of any positive human effort. Its not here to make you happy. It's not here to make you anything. It simply is.Those who deeply follow the Tao seem to reach a state of disconnection which, from the outside, looks almost like total ego death and/or massive depression.To be fair, being really depressed, and having Ego Death, and being totally absorbed in the Tao are not the same thing internally. And being really depressed is bad, probably, Ego Death is arguably one way or the other depending on circumstances, though I do not like the look of it myself, and being one with the Tao is probably good.But the only way to really know which of these is going on with someone is to basically ask them, and if they can be bothered answering you they might say ""Yes I was one with the Tao, until you interrupted me and fucked it up.You can't speak of the Tao because it is wordless. You can barely pass it on. Becoming one with it means you basically just hang around doing very little. It is so seperate from the angst and action of the human experience that there seems very little to link them.Maybe thinking about the Tao is good for you, just don't actually find it or you will become an essentially useless person. (Good from the Taoist perspective, now you are like the old tree which does not get chopped down because it has no relation to the world of things which are used).(Another thing I don't really have any respect for is the desire to hang on to life and be immortal, but that seems to have become a thing more in later slightly crapper Taoism.)But what's the point or the pleasure of such a life? It seems as grey and empty as the sky. Just hang around on a mountain being an immortal to no particular end or reason? Why even care about preserving your body if it has no purpose?Fundamentally, at my anglo materialist core, I do not trust systems of knowing which cannot be exposed to consensus reality. I don't like it. Consensus reality might be an absolute load of hysterical paper-thin bullshit, but its better than nothing.Is that it? Just stillness and pigs? It sounds better to be Robber Chih.Presumably other people have thought about this and have quite complex belief systems about how actually following Taoism results in the kinds of pro-social behaviour and recognisable fulfillment they value.

I see the natural lines and my knife slides through the great hollows, follows the great cavities, using that which is already there to my advantage. . . .' (23, ch3)'We can point to the wood that has been burned, but when the fire has passed on, we cannot know where it has gone.' (24, ch3)'This tree is certainly good for nothing,' said Tzu Chi. 'This is why it has grown so large. Ah-ha This is the sort of uselessness that sages live by. . . .' (34, ch4)'If you look at things in terms of their difference,' replied Confucius, 'then the liver and gall are as different as the states of Chu and Yueh; howeer, study them from the perspective of their sameness, and all life is one. This is what this master does. Such a man is not guided by his eyes and ears, instead he lets his heart decide what is harmonious in its Virtue. He observes the unity and does not see that which is lost. He considers the loss of his foot as being like a lump of earth thrown away.' (38-9, ch5)Small-minded people just cannot see that hiding smaller things in larger things does not mean they will not be stolen. If you take everything under Heaven and try to store it under Heaven, there is no space left for it to be lost in! This is the real truth about things. TO have a human form is a joyful thing. But in the universe of possible forms, there are others just as good. Isn't it a blessing to have these uncountable possibilities! The sage goes where nothing escapes him, and rests contented there with them. (50, ch6)'I learned it through the medium of the spirit of writing; writing learned it from the offspring of continuous study; continuous study learned it from clarity of vision; clarity of vision heard it from quiet agreement; quiet agreement from being used; being used from great enjoyment; great enjoyment from deepest mystery; deepest mystery from absorption in mystery; absorption in mystery from the ultimate.' (52, ch6)'They have truly become one with the Maker of All and now wander as the original breath of Heaven and Earth. They view life as a grotesque tumour, a swelling they inhabit. They view death as the removal of this growth.' (55, ch6)Eccentric Chieh Yu said, 'That would ruin Virtue. If someone tries to govern everything below Heaven in this way, it's like trying to stride through the seas or cut a tunnel through the river or make a mosquito carry a mountain. When a great sage is in command, he doesn't try to take control of externals.' (61, ch7)Change and Dramatic said, 'Everyone has seven orifices so they can see, hear, eat and breathe. Chaos does not have these. Let us bore some holes into him.' Each day they bored a hole into Chaos ... but on the seventh day Chaos died. (64, ch7)In situations like this world-wide, if someone makes sacrifices for reasons of benevolence and righteousness, people call such a person a nobleman, a gentleman; if someone makes such sacrifices for wealth and power, then people call such a person a mean and petty man! The action of sacrifice is one and the same, yet we call one a gentleman and the other a petty man! In terms of sacrificing his life and harming his true nature, Robber Chih and Po Yi did the same. (69, ch8)If the sage does not die, then great thieves will continue to arise. The more sages are brought forth to rule the world, the more this helps people like Robber Chih. Create weights and measures to judge by and people will steal by weight and measure; create balances and weights and people will steal by balances and weights; create contracts and legal agreements to inspire trust and people will steal by contracts and legal agreements; create benevolence and righteousness to ensure honesty and even in this instance benevolence and righteousness teach them to steal. (78, ch10)'. . . If they tried to understand this, they would depart from this. Ask not for its name, seek not for its shape. So all life comes to birth through itself.' (88, ch11)The Tao is perpetually One but needs to be modified.Heaven is spiritual but also practical.So the sages contemplate Heaven but do not assist it.They are concerned to perfect their Virtue but do not allow it to encumber them.. . . . . . .They make use of things and do not dismiss them lightly.True, things are worthless but they must be used. (90, ch11)By nature he is superior to others, but he can exploit what heaven gives him. He would try to prevent flaws, but he does not understand where they spring from. Make him the equal of Heaven? Beware, for he would rely upon others rather than on Heaven, caring for his on self first, and having little regard to the lives of others. He would pursue knowledge, and his actions would be like swift fire. He would be in bondage to his own ideas, in thrall to them, constantly looking all around to see how things are going. He would be at the mercy of demands, changing as they change and having no dependability at all. How could he be the equal of Heaven? (95, ch12)The gardener was furious, then laughed and said, 'I have heard from my teacher that where you have machines, then you get certain kinds of problems; where you get certain kinds of problems, then you find a heart warped by these problems. Where you get a heart warped, its purity and simplicity are disturbed. When purity and simplicity are disturbed, then the spirit is alarmed and an alarmed spirit is no place for the Tao to dwell. It isn't that I don't know of these machines, but I would be ashamed to use one.' (99, ch12)Similarly, ise words do not rest in the hearts of the people. Perfect words do not stay, because vulgar words are in the ascendant. Two basic drums can drown out the sound of the bell and deny the pleasure it could give. These days the whole world is confused. Even if I wanted to go in a particular direction, what good would it do? Since I understand this, if I were to try and force people to go my way, that would just be to fall into a delusion of my own. It is better just to let things be and not force them. If I don't get into such struggles, I shan't have anything to worry about. A leper has a son born at night-time and he rushes to find a light to look at him. His eagerness to see is based on his fear that the child will look like him. (103-4, ch12)

The ""Zhuangzi"" has always been one of my favorite texts, thanks to the humor, the wild flights of fantasy, the imaginative stories and parables, the poetry of its language. And of course its philosophical stance, which is a combination of relativism and skepticism, bound together by an all-pervading holism.

The ""Zhuangzi"" has always been one of my favorite texts, thanks to the humor, the wild flights of fantasy, the imaginative stories and parables, the poetry of its language. And of course its philosophical stance, which is a combination of relativism and skepticism, bound together by an all-pervading holism. At the same time, it is one of the most influential works ever written in Chinese, both within the Chinese tradition (think of poets as Tao Yuanming, Su Dongpo, Yang Wanli etc, as well as Zen Buddhism) and Japan (Basho!).The core of the Zhuangzi may be of slightly earlier date than the Daodejing (Tao Te Ching9 (around 270 BCE). These are the so-called Seven Inner Chapters usually ascribed to the historical Zhuangzi (about whom virtually nothing is known except that he lived in the last three quarters of the 4th century BCE). Besides that, the book contains writings by anonymous followers of Zhuangzi's school and others who were sympathetic to it (the Outer Chapters 8-22 and Miscellaneous Chapters 23-33).The Zhuangzi shares the philosophy of the spontaneous changes of the universe, with which the sage should try to be in accordance, with the Daodejing. Zhuangzi considered the moral patterns of the Confucians and other philosophers as artificial constructs of humans. The universe operates according to spontaneous processes and therefore humans should act spontaneously as well (translator Burton Watson calls this freedom). However, humans have the tendency to make artificial distinctions, thus removing themselves from the spontaneous processes of the natural world.The playful style and fictive anecdotes in the Zhuangzi have the purpose to help readers break out of their habitual and artificial distinctions. That is why we have Confucius renouncing ritual, or he Sage Kings giving up their positions.The philosophers of ancient China faced the same problem: how to live in a world of chaos and suffering. While the Confucians and others came with concrete action plans, the mystic Zhuangzi said: free yourself from the world.When a man named Nanrong Zhu came to visit Laozi, to ask for instruction, the Sage promptly asked: ""Why did you come with all these people?"" The man whirled around but there was nobody behind him. Of course Zhuangzi means here the baggage of old ideas, of conventional concepts of right and wrong that we all carry about. We must first discard these before we can be free. We human beings are the authors of our own suffering and bondage. Zhuangzi sums this up in the image of the leper woman, who ""when she gives birth to a child in the deep of the night, rushes to fetch a torch and examine it, trembling with terror lest it look like herself"" (Burton Watson, p. 4).Zhuangzi tries to shock us out of our bondage by paradoxical anecdotes, nonsensical remarks and pseudo-logical discussions. Another deadly weapon he uses is humor - the very core of his style.Zhuangzi is the philosopher of naturalness, of spontaneity. By just following nature, everything will be best. Applied to politics, this means the world will be ordered automatically, a spontaneous order without need for (too much) government.In the same way, death is not to be feared as it is only one of the many natural transformations. Without believing in an afterlife, Zhuangzi just tells us to trust nature: ""Zhuangzi's wife died. When Huizi went to convey his condolences, he found Zhuangzi sitting with his legs sprawled out, pounding on a tub and singing... [...] (When Huizi admonished him, Zhuangzi answered:) ""You are wrong. When she first died, do you think I didn't grieve like anyone else? But I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there has been another change and she is dead. It is just like the progression of the four seasons, spring, summer, fall, winter. Now she is going to lie down peacefully in a vast room..."" [modified from Watson, p. 191-92]The most famous story of the Zhuangzi is the ""butterfly story"" (here modified from the free Legge translation): Once Zhuangzi dreamt that he was a butterfly, a butterfly flying about, enjoying itself. He did not know that he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he awoke, and was himself again, the veritable Zhuangzi. But he did not know whether he was Zhuangzi who had dreamt that he was a butterfly, or a butterfly now dreaming that he was Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly there must be a some difference. This is called the Transformation of Things.""In China this epistemological story is so famous that it has become idiom (""Zhuang Zhou Meng Die"").The Zhuangzi is such a difficult text, also for Chinese, that you should do yourself the favor of selecting a translation by a specialist in Chinese. The best complete translation, in my view, is the one by Sinologist and prolific translator Burton Watson, published by Columbia University Press in 1968, which is still available (just as in the case of the Daodejing, there are some terrible ""translations"" on the market, made by non-specialists who have put their fantasy to work on the basis of older translations - even Penguin Books has ""sinned"" in this case).See my blog at https://adblankestijn.blogspot.com/.

TAOISM, AN ALTERNATIVE AND A PARTNERI am certainly not a specialist in Taoism. Yet this book offers some interesting elements for the standard Western reader who wants to open up to Eastern thinking.First, the yin and the yang, too famous not to be known by everyone in the West where it is seen as some kind of equilibrium swing, swinging to the left and then swinging to the right, swaying to the east and then swaying to the west, or if you prefer to get out of this square quartet-presentation and reach a Solomonic sextuple form, leaning to the north at times and then leaning to the south at other times. But we have it kind of wrong there.The yin and the yang are often seen as contradictory, hence the either-or presentation I have just given, but that’s not correct. The yin and the yang are maybe antagonistic, but they are also oxymoronic, the yin cannot exist if the yang does not exist at the same time. The yin cannot be activated if the yang is not activated at the same time. And mind you, it is not the cultivation of the middle of the way policy of some non-committing philosophers of the west. It is the fact that the two must be active at the same time. That means the Taoist philosopher or distant observer has to stand aloof, on the side, on the road shoulder of this dual carriageway and watch both lanes, one going to the left and the other to the right, one going west and the other going east, one running south and the other running north, all at the same time, even if and especially because they are contradictory, antagonistic, hence oxymoronic. That kind of thinking is unthinkable in the West where thinkers there play on the contradictions between various groups and declare these contradictions as being the engine of history in cycles of thesis-antithesis-synthesis, and the synthesis is always seen as the elimination of the contradiction and requires its elimination. We know what Marx did with this Hegelian approach in the political and social fields. Of the two – and only two – classes of this capitalistic society, one is necessarily dominant and the other necessarily dominated, and historical progress can only come if the dominant bourgeoisie is eliminated by and to the profit of the dominated proletariat that become dominant and that leads to a classless society. We know this is a myth and it led to social, political, and human catastrophes. But do not be fooled by this simple example that Lenin first, Stalin second and Mao Zedong third pushed to an extreme and vastly bloody physical elimination of the members of the designated dominant class that had to be eradicated. But do not be fooled by these examples to which some add Hitler and Mussolini, and whoever seems to be too authoritarian if not totalitarian to their taste and eyes. We can today wee a certain Donald Trump trying to govern the USA and the world with such systematically antagonizing policies. This antagonization in the USA is leading to plain simple racial riots against the public slow killing that qualifies as the lynching of a black man by one white cop with three other cops looking and doing nothing. Choke that man to death please, since he is black. And the National Guard will deal with the riots and kill a few more if necessary, for order to be restored. And that is the same with the world. First, it was North Korea, then it was Venezuela, then it was China, and it will never end. This man thinks he can only win elections and popular support if he declares war on one particular scapegoat “enemy” like Muslims, Asians, particularly Chinese, Latinos, and who knows what the next group might be. If by any chance he manages to bring Hong Kong finance center down, three million Hong Kongers will use their privileged British passport to go back home, which is Great Britain. Good morning Vietnam! And this Vietnam will be in Brexiting Great Britain, though not the United Kingdom since Northern Ireland will be kept out of the migration. THREE MILLION people arriving overnight in planes and ships. The English had already done that mistake in the Indian subcontinent with millions of people there who had British passports and used them to migrate to Great Britain when Harold Wilson accepted to recognize that a British Passport was a British Passport and had to be respected.That’s Western thinking. Nothing can be white and black at the same time; the yin and the yang do not exist in the Western mind. But it does in the Asian mind, particularly the Chinese mind, be it Taoist, Confucian or Buddhist. Books have been written on the subject. This one, despite the difficulty of the translation with notes indicating that the translation is based on a certain reading of a word, or of another word substituted to the original word in the text, but no explanation is most of the time provided, is clear-cut on this yin-yang coexistence. This leads to a very special style of binary syntax and multiple, mostly dual parallel syntactic couples. I will not quote one because there are too many. Each pair is of course bringing together two contradictory elements in systematic parallel oxymorons that no Western poet, even the most dramatic and grandiloquent, would dare to produce. At the most one quartet of such dual oxymoronic elements from time to time, but not systematic as a way of thinking. If you pacify the contradiction, hence the conflict, contained in such a way of thinking and if you accept the idea that extremes have to live together without any conflict, then you have a peaceful world. Unluckily life is never that yin-yang peaceful. So this Asian peace of mind makes me rather doubtful and yet China, or Japan, or Korea manage to live peacefully, with some tension from time to time, by bringing together extremes in objective, tolerant coexistence with simple technically mediated pacifying control that is rejected by principle in the west. With Covid-19 it is obvious that even if we consider figures to have been manipulated in Asia, which is on our side a racist attitude, especially since we know we have done the same in the west, the least we can say is this yin-yang technically mediated pacifying control was and is definitely effective. In Colorado they introduced recently a new statistical approach to Covid-19: the deaths declared as caused by Covid-19 and then those who died of some other declared disease but with the Covid-19 virus in them. This second group represented more than one-third of the first group, hence a 33% increase, and how many died of a heart attack or cancer, with the Covid-19 virus in them but who had not been tested for this virus? The only objective figure is the increase in the death rate under the Covid-19 emergency. And there the increase is a lot more than what the official count provides us with. When you read this book, you can realize how far away the East is from the West. And yin-yang “Honi soit qui mal y pense” thinking is telling us the East has to live with the West, and vice versa in peace and coexistence, and even in collaborative cooperation in spite or because of the differences. That’s what Donald Trump and the white supremacists who elected him cannot understand. They will get into some anti-Asian and anti-Chinese pogroms pretty soon, though right now today April 30 they are preparing for the forceful elimination of a Black riot. But don’t worry they will go back to anti-Asian and anti-Chinese and anti-Muslim business as soon as they can. The yin-yang coexistence of extremes sounds difficult in this white-supremacy.“To travel [1, my emphasis] across the water without shrinking from the sea serpent or the dragon [two dangers, my emphasis] – this is the courage of the fisherman. “To travel [2, my emphasis] over land without shrinking from the rhinoceros or the tiger [two dangers, my emphasis] – this is the courage of the hunter. “To see [1, my emphasis] the bare blades clashing before him and to look [2, two infinitives with visual content, my emphasis] upon death as though it were life – this is the courage of the man of ardor. “To understand [1, my emphasis] that hardship is a matter of fate [1, ternary element, my emphasis], that success is a matter of the times [2, ternary element, my emphasis], and to face [2, two infinitives with mental content, my emphasis] great difficulty without fear [3, ternary element, my emphasis] – this is the courage of the sage. Be content with it. My fate has been decided for me.” (page 185) The first two propositions are binary by the verb “to travel” and each one contains a binary hazardous situation. The next two propositions are binary by the two verbs “to see – to look” and “to understand – to face,” the first couple being visual, the second couple being mental, but the last one’, the sage’s proposition opens on a ternary perspective, though we should also consider the first two make one couple carried by one verb of mental activity, and the third one make two with the first two taken together and that third one being made dual too by the second mental verb. Which leads me to the conclusion that there might be a ternary desire, but the binary way of thinking is by far dominant and even structural. More than plain “Gestalt” (shape or figure or motif) it is “Gewalt” (force, violence, domination). There still is a lot of work to do on this Asian way of thinking the yin-yang dialectic as basic, fundamental, organic in all of us, in nature and the world, and of course the universe.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU

Oh crap, I woke up this morning and realized that the butterfly was dreaming me!!Tasty little book, includes inner and outer chapters that can be read in any order. From what I understand the translation has been somewhat simplified for the Western reader by omitting at least some of the Chinese cultural references. That said Martin Palmer’s translation is considered to be pretty good overall.I was primarily interested in checking the text out from a neuro-scientific and anti-enlightenment perspective which are both strangely supportive of Taoism. The flavor of anti-enlightenment I'm interested in is best exemplified by Schopenhauer and is expressed very nicely in modern terms by John Gray. The aspect that is most relevant to Taoism is the acknowledgment that humans aren’t too different from other species and our obsession with ‘progress’ and incessant desire to bring about a better world are both fundamentally utopian. Taoism doesn't elevate human species above the nature that they are a part of and it does not attempt to transcend human existence. This is in sharp contrast to any pre-modern or modern form of millennialism derived from Christian eschatology (and yes this applies to Enlightenment, Marxism, post-political Radical Islam, global free-market capitalism, and neo-atheism). One of the more recent manifestations is trans-humanism which is laughable on so many levels I don't know where to begin.  In that sense Taoism is also different from Buddhism, and in fact quite a few essays in the book make fun of Confucius who borrowed heavily from Buddhism. The difference between Buddhism and Taoism can be seen right away in the core principles. Buddhism, from the very start is preoccupied with attempting to escape the suffering of life on earth by transcending everyday existence and entering nirvana. Interestingly Slavoj Zizek found some very thought-provoking parallels when it comes to self-sacrifice for the good of others in both Christianity and Buddhism. Such self-sacrifice of course doesn't come for free to its recipients. Anyway, in Taoism neither escape nor self-sacrifice and its associated moral debt on anybody's part is necessary.  Taoism’s connection to neuroscience is even more fascinating. All the recent developments in brain research tend to confirm over and over again how manufactured, easily manipulated, and utterly deterministic human psyche is. Free will has been thrown out the window with Libet 30 years ago, and today the whole notion of 'self' is on the verge of crumbling (e.g. Thomas Metzinger). And ironically the part of ‘self’ that has not crumbled is inseparably enmeshed with 'other' via mimic neurons (see Vittorio Gallese). Taoism fully embraces the illusionary nature of the self and delusionary nature of human nature, and now neuroscience confirms and quantifies it. A nice full circle - I like it.I suppose I enjoyed the book for its syncretic qualities as it did provide a common context for a few disjoint subjects I have been interested in lately. And perhaps it is just one of the ways of the Tao.

Having loved Lao Tze's Tao Te Ching around 4 years ago I chose to buy books by Confucius and Chuang Tzu. Confucius is the most well known of these three philosophers whilst Chuang Tzu's biggest claim to fame was his one dream in which he questions whether he is a man dreaming he was a butterfly or a butterfly now dreaming that he is a man (mentioned in Borge's 'New refutation of time').First, I read The Analects by Confucius, and was largely underwhelmed.

Having loved Lao Tze's Tao Te Ching around 4 years ago I chose to buy books by Confucius and Chuang Tzu. Confucius is the most well known of these three philosophers whilst Chuang Tzu's biggest claim to fame was his one dream in which he questions whether he is a man dreaming he was a butterfly or a butterfly now dreaming that he is a man (mentioned in Borge's 'New refutation of time').First, I read The Analects by Confucius, and was largely underwhelmed. In comparison with the more radical elements of Lao Tze, Confucius seemed to be full of rules and ways of living. It was much more conservative. It even put me off reading more Chinese philosophy for a while. Chuang Tzu was unfortunately kept on the book-shelf for another 2-3 years untouched.I picked up Chuang Tzu two months ago hoping to reignite some of the beauty and freedom of Lao Tze. As a three, Confucius is seen as the most conservative, with Lao Tze left of him, and Chuang Tzu as the most radical. Fortunately for me, and for my interest in Chinese literature, Chuang Tzu did not disappoint.Firstly, it is mostly written in prose, unlike Lao Tze. However, this does not diminish it's impact at all. The images and metaphors are great, the stories are interesting, and there is even some humour: there is a craftsman chosen by royalty because he is found sitting naked on his floor instead of doing anything, there is a bird confused why he is being treated like a human, and plenty of jabs at Confucius and his failure to find the true Tao.Secondly, as I had hoped, there is plenty of passages that capture a similar, and often more pertinent, magic prevalent in the Tao Te Ching. For example:'Someone offered Chuang Tzu a court post. Chuang Tzu answered the messenger, 'Sir, have you ever seen a sacrificial ox? It is decked in fine garments and fed on fresh grass and beans. However, when it is led into the great temple, even though it most earnestly might wish to be a simple calf again, it is now impossible.'It is a bit more of a challenge to read than the Tao Te Ching because of the length (although the prose is arguably easier to read). Do bear with it, because I reaped more rewards as I read further. Particular highlights included the chapters titled 'Season of Autumn Floods' and 'Abdication'. Enjoy! And read Lao Tze's Tao Te Ching if you haven't already.

This would've been such a slamdunk 5 stars, if this wasn't most definitely written by more than one guy under the name ""Zhuangzi."" One's a really smart, brilliant cookie. The other is a dull partypooper.I really like Zhuangzi --he's a thoughtful, funny, frustrating, and anarchic old guy who's just tired of everyday BS. He tells confusing, entertaining nonsense stories and leaves it to the reader to figure out what the hell he's talking about. Some of my favorite stories:* Zhuangzi uses a skull for a pillow. He talks to the skull in his dreams and asks the skull if it wants to come back to life and see his family and friends again. The skulls says to buzz off.* A doctor brags to Zhuangzi about how he serves the king and has hundreds of carriages. Zhuangzi says of course the king gave the doctor hundreds of carriages -- he must have been licking the king's hemorrhoids.* A cripple laughs at his condition. Who knows what new shapes his body will take? Maybe his hand will become a crossbow. Maybe his ass will become cartwheels and he can hook himself up to a horse!* Two kings visiting a formless blob want to do something nice for their blob friend. They notice he doesn't have eyes, ears, nostrils, or a mouth. So they drill a new hole into him each day. On the seventh day, the blob dies. The end.But the other ""Zhuangzi"" is a boring, dry fart of a commentator. Bloated and long-winded, their biggest sin is they try to make SENSE of the good Zhuangzi. It's like if right after Jesus told the parable of the Prodigal Son, St. Peter bellies up to the podium and explains God will love you even if you're a dick. Like frogs, parables are a lot less fun when they're dissected.So honestly, if you want to read Zhuangzi, read Watson's Basic Writings of Zhuangzi, which snips out the weaker parts. Either way, for something over two thousand years old, it sure feels evergreen. The subversive power of Zhuangzi's stories is they're so innocuously silly that they'll slip right underneath some people's noses, but even a kid can understand the importance of a dude's buttcheeks becoming cartwheels.

Chaung Tzu is a gifted - and often humorous - storyteller, and the simplicity of his narratives often belie the deep truths they convey. To try to categorize or organize the themes in this book go against its spirit. As Chaung Tzu frequently reminds his readers, the Tao cannot be defined or understood. However, these are some of the lessons I gleaned from my reading:Live according to your nature (hsing), and don’t try to be something you’re not. If you do, not only will you be unhappy, but you will make everyone around you unhappy. Be who you are, and you will be happy.Too much benevolence can be just as harmful as too much vice, because both go against nature. Balance is key, although the center is not fixed, so one must be flexible. Ambition is pointless – in the short term, it may be successful, but in the long term it is not, and whatever it achieves is ephemeral. This is especially true of political and military aspirations – something Chuang Tzu frequently dwells on. Actionless action (wu wei) is the preferred way of living. There is much in this book I did not understand, and I will revisit it in the future. However, this is not a book that is meant to be fully comprehended or given a definitive interpretation. In fact, Chuang Tzu would say that the less you understand it, the better.

It was also very unlike other philosophies because it was extremely fun to read…though somewhat confusing as well. For example, chapter two “On Equalizing Things” is like reading a more intense version of Alice in Wonderland. It repeats words multiple times and uses the same word to explain the opposite. Almost the entire chapter is set up in this fashion. The following are a few of the more complicated verses: This one is written like a riddle: “There is a beginning. There is a not-yet beginning to be a beginning. There is a not yet beginning to be a not-yet beginning to be a beginning.” To me it describes the necessity of the cycle of life.This one is one of my favorite lessons, it is written in a fun way, kind of like Dr. Seuss: “People say that Maoqiang and Lady Li are beautiful. But if a fish saw them they would dive deep, if birds saw them they would fly high, and if deer saw them they would cut and run. Of these four, which knows beauty rightly?” This passage really stood out at me as a fantastic way to explain the differences between perspectives and culture. Not everyone is the same or thinks the same way. What is pretty to one person could be ugly to another.

But I could not tell, had I been Chuang Tzu dreaming I was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming I was now Chuang Tzu?So having carriages and badges of office is no reason for becoming proud and arrogant in our purposes, nor are distress and poverty any reason for becoming vulgar. View both conditions as one and the same, so be free from anxiety and leave it at that. So if loss of what gives happiness causes you distress when it fades, you can now understand that such happiness is worthless. It is said, those who lose themselves in their desire for things also lose their innate nature by being vulgar.One who does not exist in self sees others as they really are. His movement is like water, his calmness like a mirror, his response is like that of an echo. When he is empty, he seems to have forgotten; unmoving, he is as still as water; peaceful, he is as one with all; he views success as failure, and he never tries to take the lead but always to follow.

(Not that I'm knowledgeable enough to speak. :P )I personally find the Chuang Tzu attractive because of its apparent liberal attitude. Chuang Tzu the man was quite laissez-faire: not as what Western people may think when they heard the phrase, but rather, a laissez-faire attitude shaping-and-contorting to context and situation of ""The Way"".Definitely recommended for those interested in Eastern religions or philosophy.

Master Zhuang was one eccentric fellow, and that reflects through this translation by Burton Watson. This is a book doesn't need to be read all at once, but would be better to come back to daily or nightly. It is a comforting read, the only thing I would ask for would be some illustrations to go along with the text. One of the greatest Asian philosophy books ever!

I thought I need to know, given the importance of China as a major economic power in today’s world. Somewhere in the same storage unit I have a very old Penguin Classics edition of the Tao Te Ching usually ascribed to the legendary founder of Taoism, Lao Tzu. I see there is a more recent Penguin Classics translation of the Tao Te Ching, and I would advise the reader to tackle this before reading Chuang Tzu. Martin Palmer explains the relationship between the two in the introduction to Chuang Tzu. He also gives his take on whether Lao Tzu existed or not. Not, apparently. That is disappointing, as I have always liked the idea of Lao Tzu taking the proverbial out of Confucius. A few months ago I read Gore Vidal’s Creation, in which the narrator – a Persian traveller – meets Confucius, Lao Tzu, the Buddha and Socrates. This would have just about been possible if the traditional dates given for the life spans are correct. Surprisingly, Vidal clearly prefers Confucius to Lao Tzu, as human beings anyway. Surprising because I associate Confucius with things Vidal doesn’t usually like: authoritarianism, hierarchy, order, obedience, tradition. You can draw a straight line between Confucius, Mao Ze Dong and the current regime in Beijing. On the other hand, Lao Tzu seems to be more liberal, seditious, sceptical, playful, contrarian, mocking. And those traits are replicated in Chuang Tzu who often uses Confucius as a figure of fun, a philosopher who has a knack of getting it wrong. But then so do all the other philosophical schools mentioned in this book. They are all trying to find the Tao, but they just don’t get it. Having said that, I’m not sure that I get it, although I’ve been trying to get it for nearly fifty years now. If you’re looking for a simple explanation of the Tao, you won’t find it in the introduction or in the body of this book. The translator sees Chuang Tzu’s philosophy as a development of shamanism set against the bureaucratic philosophies of Confucius and others. You could argue that their concern with order and good government is sensible and practical, whereas the Taoist injunction, “do nothing and all things will be done,” doesn’t seem to make any sense – until you think about it and realise that the more us humans do to disrupt the natural world, the more damage we do.This translation is already 25 years old but is fresh and lively and as the blurb on the back says, it “conveys the passion and tone of Chuang Tzu’s writing”. I’d recommend it for anyone who wants to try to understand the Tao, or at least get some insight into an important aspect of Chinese culture.I first read The Book of Chuang Tzu in an earlier translation back in the 80s and found it weird, strange and compelling.

To see the culture and how things were like, and the texts left behind from those eras fascinates me. this book was very fun to read as it is a book of short stories, different events and things that happened often seen through a taoist perspective. If you've an interest in Chinese history or Taoism then this is 2nd to the Tao te ching.

I stumbled upon Chuang Tzu during a careless search of Taoist poetry. Now that I’ve read this book I can safely say that it’s best to stumble upon such work—prose that’s vivid but stark, accessible yet impenetrable, and useful yet worthless. Perhaps we’re all just butterflies dreaming of this world. I recommend this book to every person whose ever doubted the people who judge.

It is quite a read. Gradually you realize that many stories emphasize the same basic ideas.The fact that you had to ignore that Kongzi was explained 20 times as Confucius and the many notes on names that were in my opinion unimportant for an understanding of the deeper meaning of the story, was a bit irritating.

Burton Watson is the gold standard for Zhuangzi translations. All others defer or refer to him. This book contains not only the inner chapters, those that are reliably attributable to Zhuangzi the person, but also the outer chapters. I bought this because I was constantly finding passages being cited and wanted to be able to read the full chapter for context. A must have reference.

One of the founders of Taoism, Chuang Tzu lived in the fourth century before Jesus' birth, and this book is a lengthly compilation of his musings and stories.The only criticism I might dare pose about this book is that it makes essentially the same point -- one can quibble about whether there are many ""points"" or, in essence, just one -- over and over, presented in various scenarios.So please take my summary here as MY impression only, for I may have missed grasping the essence of what Master Chuang is teaching.First, and not surprisingly, it is really much more of ""a piece of"" classic wisdom literature rather than a ""separate"" branch of wisdom. Not surprisingly, really, for my limited understanding of these ancient great masters -- including, of course, Jesus of Nazareth -- reveals how they shared essentially the same understandings of what ""had to be done"" if we were to escape what Jesus called the false values of ""this world"" and come to an understanding of what is truly important.In my language, much of Taoism consists of ""letting go"" of illusions of grandeur, pretensions, obsessions with status or plans or how things are or are not working, and just BEING one's self. I do not mean to demean the idea by saying it reminds me of the modern expression, ""Just go with the flow.""This certainly does not mean accepting or, worse, aiding evil, but it demands a true ""situational awareness"" of each of us. As the ancient Greeks urged, ""Know thyself."" This knowledge is not ""out there"" but, rather, within us. But most of us are far too busy far too much of the time thinking, planning, (plotting?), executing, worrying, etc. than just ""hanging loose."" The idea of the ""good"" or ""noble"" person, so much a concern of Confucius, is less explicit here, but it is nonetheless integral to one who has found -- or who lives -- the Way. After all, there is nothing noble or good about ""putting on airs,"" pretending to be that which we are not, or even beating ourselves up for what we have not been able to accomplish.We are to take time, observe, listen, and quietly assess. Armed with calmness and peace we can then go about our daily lives behaving as we are meant to.Like all wisdom teachings, fairly easy to grasp after thinking about, but damned difficult to put into sustained practice!

As an experience, the book initially a great joy to read. Gradually it became a challenge where a universe of questions exploded in me, of which some were: Do you know what's right? Do you know what's wrong? Do you know what is real? Do you know when you are dreaming? Do you know what it means to know? Do you know what it means not to know? Is Zhuangzi bullshitting you? Are you bullshitting yourself? How did our ancestors (for example, the hunters and gatherers) approach these questions? In what ways were they supreme to you? In what way were they lacking? How do you know this? How can you make use of these questions? What makes these stories so hard to comprehend? What makes the truth of the stories is so simple? Along this journey, I discovered the topic of the book as it started to take shape in myself; perhaps it is the topic that I myself had chosen to see in the stories; or perhaps it is the topic that had been intended from the start. The message became clear within me, yet it is not a message that can simply be passed on outside of myself. Experience the challenge of the stories within this book yourself and observe what takes shape. It is a challenge worth taking, when you allow it to shape itself within you.

The Emperor of the North Sea is called Dramatic. The Emperor of the Centre is called Chaos. Change and Dramatic met every so often in the region of Chaos. Chaos always treated them kindly and virtuously. Change and Dramatic said, ""Everyone has seven orifices so they can see, hear, eat and breathe. Chaos does not have these.

Definitely not a primer in Taoist philosophy. It requires some time to get used to the rambling style and indirect messages of the content assembled here and translated by Hinton. I do appreciate the authors effort to present things as they were and as closely as possible as the original writers intended them to be, full of strange humor, illustrious characters, and sage bits of wisdom.Why are there no female sages in the Taoist cannon?

Some chapters (like Broken Suitcases, Season Of Autumn Floods, Supposed Words) were still wonderful and I'm sure will always be wonderful, but others were just a drag to read through - very much not in the spirit of Chuang Tzu.

In particular, being somewhat familiar with 'Dao De Jing', I found the many references to ""Heaven and Earth"" in Chuang-Tzu confusing. Heaven seemed to have assumed the role of the Dao in much of the text. I am really unclear as to the relationship of the two concepts here in a way that I am not in 'DDJ'.-I was most impressed by Graham's introductory notes which give a good sense of where Chuang-Tzu is coming from. Simultaneously, I read Graham's section on Chuang-Tzu in his 'Disputers of the Tao' for added understanding.-Over all, I appreciated the textual notes which added yet greater clarity to the text. I would have appreciated more information on translation however. The 'List of Characters' at the back would be helpful if the characters appeared in the text, but they don't. It would also have been helpful if he had cited translation issues in the text.

This work, along with the Tao Te Ching of Lao Tzu, is considered to be the framework over which the philosophy of Taoism developed. Parables tend to be enigmatic at the best of times and this collection, written not only centuries but millennia ago, is no exception. This isn't a work to be read once and then put aside. These stories will send you off down a path you didn't intend to follow and then bring you back where you started, with the story itself.

Chuang Tsu is a primary articulator of early Taoist philosophy. This is my first exposure to his writings. Initially, and for now, I am drawn more to Lao Tsu’s aphoristic style, insights and emphasis. Some of this writing I like a lot. The interconnectedness of things, the power relationships between them and the balance point in those relationships, are conveyed in passages such as this: “When there is no more separation between ‘this’ and ‘that,’ it is called the still-point of Tao. At the still-point in the center of the circle one can see the infinite in all things.” The ebb and flow of energy comes through with this: “When there is separation, there is coming together. When there is coming together, there is dissolution.” Merging into the background, and going with the flow rather than standing out, is a prudent survival strategy, as conveyed by this: “I have been trying for a long time to be useless,” and this: “When I say he has no desire,” Chuang Tsu says, “I mean that he does not disturb his inner well-being with likes and dislikes. He accepts things as they are and does not try to improve upon them.” Chuang Tsu writes of the true man: “Carefree he went. Carefree he came. That was all.” That man accepts “what he was given with delight, and when it was gone, he gave it no more thought. This is called not using the mind against Tao and not using man to help heaven.” As the introduction suggests (these writings are an anticipation of Zen Buddhism and a “laying of the foundation for a state of emptiness or ego transcendence”), the “Inner Chapters” also seem to transition into something other than what is seen in Tao Te Ching. For example, speaking of a Tao sage who, having transcended “the physical world,” and “all material existence,” and, having seen the One, he began to transcend the distinction of past and present…to enter the land where there is no life or death, where killing does not take away life and giving birth does not add to it.” In another passage, Yen Hui, a Taoist seeker, says: “‘I am not attached to the body and I give up any idea of knowing. By freeing myself from the body and mind, I become one with the infinite. This is what I mean by sitting and forgetting.”’ Right or wrong, in this first reading I sensed a tension in the “Inner Chapters” between a Tao as an impersonal energy stream that one learns to adjust to and work with in a cosmos where there is nothing beyond death, and a Tao as an eternal reality that one can merge with and, thereby, and in that way, live forever.

Daoism as Zhuangzi sees it would clearly relieve you of all anxiety, plus you'd be like... on to ""it"".Of course, that seems kind of paradoxical.. how can there be ""a"" way. a ""the"" way. How can you ever leave the way.So Zhuangzi gets all Catholic about it and talks about the kind of knowing and acting that a person who is so long practiced at something they no longer think about it but simply do and do it perfectly. Ok... how do we get there oh wise one? and to this, dude who may never have existed and even if he did all we have is some really messed up writings that are older than the bible.. well he doesn't tell you. Not really.In the end, Zhuangzi is like a jump into a cold pool from the sauna of your life. I think it's less important what he's trying to say, if he's trying to say anything, and more important what it makes you think about.but that's true of just about everything by my philosophy...why are you reading a review of a book anyway?

Chuang Tsu/Inner Chapters is a companion volume to Gia-fu Feng and Jane English's translation of Lao Tsu/Tao Te Ching, which has enjoyed great success since its publication in 1972, and is having a 25th anniversary edition published in 1997.Chuang Tsu was to Lao Tsu as Saint Paul was to Jesus and Plato to Socrates. This book contains what are known as the seven ""Inner Chapters"" of his teaching—that part of his work which is acknowledged by scholars as having definitely been written by him. Chuang Tsu developed the doctrines of Taoism with rigorous logic. His fables and humor are imaginative and poetic, reflecting a brilliant and original mind. He advocated relativity with regard to all standards and values. He was at once a mystic and a revolutionary. The rhythm of life and its organic vision, an idea poetically implied by Lao Tsu, is brought to perfect expression in the writings of Chuang Tsu.Very little is known about Chuang Tsu and that little is inextricably woven into legend. While the other philosophers were busying themselves with the practical matters of government and rules of conduct, Chuang Tsu transcended the whang cheng, the illusory dust of the world—thus anticipating Zen Buddhism's emphasis on a state of emptiness or ego transcendence. With humor, imagery and fantasy, he captures the depth of Chinese thinking.

Ziporyn sometimes makes choices that seem odd to me. He translates ""Dao"" as ""Course"" rather than the more common ""Way."" One of my favorite stories at 2:38 is a conversation between two characters that Ziporyn calls Nie Que and Wang Ni rather than translating their amusing nicknames as ""Gaptooth"" and ""Royal Relativity"" as you'd find in Paul Kjellberg's translation in Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy. And there's a poignant story of Zhuangzi reacting to his wife's death, which Ziporyn doesn't include (along with the entirety of chapter 18, where that story takes place).But these are relatively minor complaints compared to the excellent things about this volume. Ziporyn's introduction is extremely helpful and interesting on the history of the text and its contemporary interpretations as well as explaining some of what people have been finding so intriguing about Zhuangzi for thousands of years. His translation is for the most part smoothly readable and seems to capture Zhuangzi's philosophical depth and humor (as far as I can tell, anyway). His footnotes and glossary are helpful. He provides excerpts from commentaries on the Inner Chapters, which as someone starting to take a more scholarly interest in the text I was excited to read.I heartily recommend this translation for anyone looking to get a bit deeper into Zhuangzi's text.

A deeply insightful and poetic work, it is always hard to capture the original in translation but Ziporyn does well - at times, though the translation seems ""looser"" than previous translations such as Graham's (which remains the most academic and thorough). This is one of the most recent translations of the Zhuangzi and thus benefits from that. The most worthwhile aspect of this edition is, as previously mentioned, the additional commentaries and an interesting introduction.

The language throughout the writings themselves, which only span about the first half of the book, is precise enough to apply to real problems that people have today, while vague enough that they don't require someone to be of a certain faith, have a certain background, or whatever other divisive factors could be part of a philosophy book. Zhuangzi brings forth many examples, many of which are obviously created just to exemplify a point, but the names can be replaced with individuals that you may actually know, and other notions can remind you of specific people or cultural routines.For example, in one part, he talks about a man who had one of his feet chopped off as punishment for a crime, and when confronted about living idealistically while missing something people get so accustomed to having that they couldn't imagine missing it, he states that he has adjusted to life without the foot so much that he doesn't even feel any different. He may look differently, but he doesn't feel like a lesser person just because of a physical difference. Other nuggets of wisdom include the idea that everyone knows how much they want to be useful, but nobody knows the value in uselessness--one example brought forth is a massive tree that has gnarled roots and terrible quality wood. A master carpenter wants nothing to do with it, because it is useless: the tree has prolonged its life because of how useless it is. At the same time, it survives without genuine purpose. So would you rather live a short life that is full of purpose, or a long life in which you are merely existing, and nothing more? I brought this up to a friend, and she seemed taken aback that I'd suggest a short life well lived is more fulfilling than a long life that can be spent enjoying trivialities and existing for them. But that's one of the problems with modern cultures: we live for the momentary enjoyment, rather than the lasting contentment. As Confucius once said, ""A man who understands the Tao [or Dao, since they are synonymous] in the morning may die without regret in the evening.” And honestly, it's better to live knowing that you contributed than to know that you wasted your time.The amazing thing that I found with this set of writings, from the Inner Chapters, Outer Chapters, and Miscellaneous Chapters, is that while on the surface, many of them talk about the Course and Virtuosity in a spiritual sounding medium, they can be applied to devout and secular individuals alike. Everyone has their own version of what ""being a good person"" is like, and many of the traits are held in common at their core. If you view this as nothing more than an ancient Chinese philosopher rambling, at least you can get plenty of thought provoking questions out of it that will stay with you for quite a while. This truly is a manifesto for criticizing problems that people create on their own, while giving ideas for how changes in attitude and habit can make life much more enjoyable, simplified, and ultimately, more tranquil. Now for the styling of the book. I don't know the traditional text, nor have I read any other versions of Zhuangzi's writings, but Brook Ziporyn (the translator and editor) organized this in a fantastic way, giving references all throughout the text, extra notes in passages that have potentially alternate meanings, and a glossary of Chinese characters that show up frequently, alongside an elaborate explanation of what those characters mean and add contextually. So, even though the original writings are Zhuangzi's, Ziporyn has made them much more accessible and thoroughly explained.

Although Ziporyn translates Dao as ""Course"" instead of the more popular ""Way,"" the text is incredibly readable and flows well, seeming to preserve much of the style of the original, even if certain parts, like the jokes don't seem to come across as well in the English. Overall, it's a lively and entertaining read, and a perhaps a good introductory text to Daoist ideas for modern Anglophone readers. In contrast to most western philosophy, the anecdotal and light-hearted nature of Zhuangzi makes for a refreshing read on old problems.

Following the Tao (the Way) is a method of being in the world but not of it. This volume translates certain key texts of the Tao, here mostly short stories featuring the rich and powerful, their advisors, set up against the followers of the Way. Followers of the Way don’t chase after riches, follow ceremony or boast at their good fortune. They also do not lament their penury or bad fortune. They don’t lose their temper needlessly, don’t engage in argument or political debates, and don’t devise schemes for getting some people to help others. They follow their natural inclinations of the necessary and do what seems right. They abide. Frequently Confucius, the obsequious do-gooder, rule maker, stander on ceremony and rites, gets the full treatment, when by all his officious interference, he makes things worse. Why? People who constantly seek after wealth and fame are bad for the health of society, but making rules for their behavior doesn’t correct the problem, and probably just makes it worse, because people will inevitably come to believe that so long as they are following the rules, they have nothing to be ashamed of and everything to be proud of. This volume frequently reminded me of Christian teaching, viz., as the Apostle Paul said, more than once, “For I am conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not by this acquitted.” Or, if you prefer, “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” Or, as Jesus said, “Let he among you who is without sin cast the first stone.” Or, if you prefer, “Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log in your own?” The blindness of pride is a constant problem—everywhere. The Way of the Tao is to fight against it by giving up on nearly everything, by eliminating the probable sources of pride, and trying to see the world in an entirely different way.

When many think of the essential text of Taoism (Daoism) they think of the Tao Te Ching. This is true. However, if you really want to get inside of the tenets of philosophical daoism, you must read Chuang Tzu.

Martin Palmer's translation was the first translation of Chuang Tzu I ever read, and the book had such a profound effect on me that it's unlikely that any other translation will ever supplant Palmer's as my preferred translation. But Mair certainly gives it a valiant effort. Mair's translation is highly accessible and readable in it's own right.

Martin Palmer's translation was the first translation of Chuang Tzu I ever read, and the book had such a profound effect on me that it's unlikely that any other translation will ever supplant Palmer's as my preferred translation. But Mair certainly gives it a valiant effort. Mair's translation is highly accessible and readable in it's own right. Like Palmer, he appears to understand that Chuang Tzu's (or, at least, the ""royal"" Chuang Tzu, since the books was almost certainly written by more than one or two people) philosophy and his humor are not two different entities sharing space between two book covers. They are one and the same. This is important because the importance of the humor and absurdities has a tendency to elude other translators.One aspect of the translation that I feel does supersede Palmer's is in how Mair translates certain names. In Chinese, one word can have a dozen or so meanings, and it's possible in Chinese literature that the author intends that word to mean several of those meanings, if not all of them, and therefore it is often difficult to translate words with several entendres or puns. Mair, though, gives it a better effort than the others, and actually translates some of the names as words they could've meant. This again adds to the humor, absurdity and philosophical significance of the story. If I have to dock Mair somewhere, it's that he didn't include footnotes for explaining some of the aspects of the stories that wouldn't be immediately understood by the modern reader. In the end, of course, until I learn Chinese and read Chuang Tzu in its original language, it will be impossible for me to conclude which translator was truer to its source material. However, as far as my ignorance will let me think, I think for the typical person with an interest in reading this book, either Mair's or Palmer's translations would be the best, most entertaining place to start.

Not accessible, but after even a first read, this book shows its value. For the un-initiated into Daoism it's a brutal first course. Even after several college courses and long, box-wine inspired conversations with fellow Peace Corps volunteers, the book continues to elude me, and the philosophy which underpins it. Comic, spontaneous, wild and challenging. Some of the parables remain clear and vital to this day. Get some background (or read the introduction very carefully) before plunging in. An

A very nice, accessible version of this text. The translator tried to produce a version that was nice to read, if not 100% faithful to the original text. Success!

That's from the last chapter which includes that description of Zhuangzi among reviews of several other Chinese philosophers and philosophical schools.This translation insists its irreverence (the author of the Tao Te Ching is called ""Longears,"" for example) can be found in the original text. I've never read a whole collection of Zhuangzi before, and I was expecting more stuff like the Butterfly Dream, not an extended battle rap against Confucius. As the subtitle already makes clear, not everything in 'the Zhuangzi' is attributed to him, and translator Victor H. Mair explains where some of the other texts are coming from. In the back there are explanations of some of the recurring terms, like ""the myriad things"" and ""all under heaven"" that Mair uses. The world of these stories (is it the warring states period 475–221 BC?) is peopled with wise-ass fishermen and carpenters, rapacious kings, ridiculous sages, and holy fools galore. Confusing, but fun.

A fish-trap is for catching fish; once you've caught the fish, you can forget about the trap. A rabbit-snare is for catching rabbits; once you've caught the rabbit, you can forget about the snare. Words are for catching ideas; once you've caught the idea, you can forget about the words. Where can I find a person who knows how to forget about words so that I can have a few words with him?
